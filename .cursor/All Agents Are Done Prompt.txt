WK5 sprint status (final)

Status (confirmed via agent logs)
- Agent 11 posted `wk5_r6`: ✅ all required gates PASS; ✅ snapshots captured; ✅ gallery rebuilt; ✅ Build B polish verified ready for signoff.
- Agent 03 posted `wk5_r6`: ✅ debris event emission + deterministic debris seeding confirmed (no Python hash()).

Sprint status
- WK5 is effectively **DONE**. The only remaining “work” is a **human manual live-play sanity check** (can’t be automated):
  - Watch Ranger/SkeletonArcher/Ballista fire and confirm projectiles are readable.
  - Destroy/demolish a building and confirm rubble remains.

Next prompt: NOT NEEDED (unless you want a final “manual signoff” log entry)
If you want it, send to Agent 11 only.

PROMPT START
WK5 Manual signoff log (optional)

Write your reply under:
`sprints["wk5-demolition-projectiles-workers"].rounds["wk5_r7"]`

Run `python main.py --no-llm` and do a 5-minute manual check:
- Confirm ranged projectiles are readable in live play (Ranger + SkeletonArcher + Ballista).
- Confirm debris appears after destroying/demolishing a building and persists.

Reply with: PASS/FAIL + any issues observed + minimal repro steps.
