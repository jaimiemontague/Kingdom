(I can create assets regardless; integration validation depends on the finalized contract.)\\n\\n## Recommended next actions\\n- Wait for Agent 3 contracts regarding inside-building + any animation-state signals before suggesting any engine-side state mapping tweaks.\\n- Begin producing the 4-class sprite set in the specified folder structure (Build B).\\n- Coordinate with Tools/QA only via their published harness: adopt their deterministic scenario for quick visual verification once it exists.\\n",

Round 1 deliverable is **art direction + asset conventions** (not a big implementation dump): define a cohesive UI skin direction (Majesty-like) and a safe plan for ingesting CC0/open-license pixel art with clean attribution while keeping `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` green.\\n\\n## Deliverables (Round 1 outputs)\\n- UI art direction constraints (palette/value, outlines, 9-slice style, icon readability) suitable for 1080p UI.\\n- Asset conventions for sprite ingestion (heroes/enemies/buildings) and UI icon/sheet usage without breaking pixel integrity.\\n- Acceptance criteria + test gates for Build A (UI + borderless) and Build B (asset ingestion).\\n\\n## Proposed changes (file boundaries; Round 1 = plan/spec only)\\n- Docs (safe, low-conflict):\\n  - Extend `docs/art/pixel_style_guide.md` with a short UI-skin section (panel materials, value ramps, outline rules).\\n  - Add `docs/art/ui_skin_style_guide.md` describing: 1080p UI scale targets, 9-slice padding rules, button states, and icon sizes (16/20/24 px).\\n- Assets (Build B, larger change):\\n  - Populate existing sprite override directories:\\n    - `assets/sprites/heroes/<class>/<action>/*.png`\\n    - `assets/sprites/enemies/<type>/<action>/*.png`\\n    - `assets/sprites/buildings/<type>/<state>/*.png`\\n  - UI sprites (optional; Build B): `assets/sprites/ui/` for icon PNGs if we move beyond procedural icons.\\n  - Attribution structure (expected, but owned by Tools/Ops): `assets/ATTRIBUTION.md` + `assets/third_party/<pack_name>/...`\\n\\n## Art direction (UI + sprites)\\n### 1) UI skin (Majesty-inspired, modern readable)\\n- **Value-first readability**: panels should be darker than world; text/icons high-value with 1px outline or shadow.\\n- **Materials**: carved wood + parchment + metal trims; avoid pure black/white.\\n- **9-slice panels**: corners must remain crisp; avoid gradients that band at 1080p.\\n- **Iconography**: prefer silhouette icons over text for bottom command bar; keep icon sizes consistent (recommended 20px) with a 1px outline and a dark plate for world-overlays.\\n- **State language**: hover/pressed/disabled should be readable with 2–3 value steps, not just hue shift.\\n\\n### 2) Sprite ingestion coherence\\n- Keep sprites **32x32 aligned** (or deterministically scaled to that); no smoothing/filtered scaling.\\n- Maintain class color accents consistent with existing placeholder language (Warrior=blue, Ranger=green, Rogue=desat steel/gray, Wizard=purple).\\n- Prefer packs with consistent outline thickness and ramp style; if mixed packs are unavoidable, normalize via palette/value adjustments.\\n\\n## Acceptance criteria + gates\\n### Build A (Midweek): borderless 1920x1080 + UI skeleton (no new art dependency)\\n- Default launch is **borderless 1920×1080**, or **borderless at native display resolution** if smaller.\\n- UI layout is readable at 1080p (no overlaps; text not clipped; minimap/panels fit).\\n- `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` remains PASS.\\n- Manual smoke (10 min) in both:\\n  - `python main.py --no-llm`\\n  - `python main.py --provider mock`\\n\\n### Build B (Endweek): pixel art for everything visible + attribution\\n- Heroes/enemies/buildings use pixel sprites when assets exist; procedural fallback OK for missing frames.\\n- Attribution is complete and clean (human-readable + verbatim license text preserved).\\n- No regressions: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` PASS.\\n\\n## Exact test commands (what I will treat as gates)\\n- Required: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick`\\n- Required manual: `python main.py --no-llm` and `python main.py --provider mock`\\n- Asset presence validation: to be added by Tools/QA (Agent 12/11) as a script; I will not guess the final command name.\\n\\n## Risks\\n- Mixed-pack art style drift (different outlines/palettes) makes the game feel inconsistent; mitigate by choosing one primary pack per category or normalizing ramps.\\n- UI scaling conflicts: if borderless+scaling strategy changes later, UI art sizing could thrash; mitigate by waiting for Agent 3’s locked scaling contract before producing UI sheet pixel sizes beyond icons.\\n- Repo size bloat: large CC0 packs can balloon repo; mitigate by selecting minimal subsets and documenting source packs in `assets/third_party/`.\\n\\n## Dependencies (blockers only)\\n- Agent 3 contract decision: final window scaling / UI scale strategy (so UI art can be authored at the correct pixel scale).\\n- Agent 12 + Agent 13 conventions: final attribution folder/file rules and validation approach (so we ingest packs compliantly without rework).\\n\\n## Recommended next actions\\n- Wait for Agent 3’s scaling/window contract before creating any fixed-size UI sprite sheets beyond small icons.\\n- In parallel: shortlist 1–2 CC0/open-license packs per category (UI, heroes, enemies, buildings) and record pros/cons for cohesion.\\n- Once attribution conventions are locked: ingest pack subsets into existing override folders and add required attribution files.\\n",

No assets committed in this step; this is the integration plan for Tooling/QA/Ops to execute safely with attribution and minimal bloat.\\n\\n## Primary pack family (LOCKED)\\n**Primary**: **Kenney (CC0 / open-license on asset pages; verify per-pack before ingest)**\\n- Rationale: single-source cohesion across categories; clear silhouettes; consistent outline/value ramps; easy to curate subsets; scales cleanly to 32×32 with nearest-neighbor.\\n\\n**Minimal fallback (ONLY if primary lacks a required sprite/animation cleanly)**\\n- **LPC (Liberated Pixel Cup) characters** for hero animations only (walk/attack/hurt coverage).\\n  - Note: license is open but often attribution-required; only use if we decide to commit to LPC look for heroes or can normalize palette/outlines.\\n\\n## Mapping table (current entity types → planned sprites)\\n### Heroes (`assets/sprites/heroes/<class>/<action>/frame_###.png`)\\nInitial Build B rule: 1-frame placeholders are acceptable per action; we will duplicate a single canonical sprite into each action folder as `frame_000.png` until we add true multi-frame animation.\\n- `warrior` → Kenney: **Knight/Warrior** sprite (action folders: idle/walk/attack/hurt/inside use same frame_000 initially)\\n- `ranger` → Kenney: **Archer/Ranger** sprite\\n- `rogue` → Kenney: **Thief/Rogue** sprite\\n- `wizard` → Kenney: **Mage/Wizard** sprite\\n\\n### Enemies (`assets/sprites/enemies/<type>/<action>/frame_###.png`)\\n- `goblin` → Kenney: **Goblin/green humanoid monster**\\n- `wolf` → Kenney: **Wolf**\\n- `skeleton` → Kenney: **Skeleton**\\nActions to satisfy: `idle`, `walk`, `attack`, `hurt`, `dead` (duplicate 1 frame per action initially if needed).\\n\\n### Buildings (`assets/sprites/buildings/<building_type>/<state>/frame_###.png`)\\nInitial Build B rule: satisfy `built`, `construction`, `damaged` with at least one PNG each. If we lack distinct art for construction/damaged, duplicate the built frame into those state folders as `frame_000.png` (placeholder) so the validator can pass while we iterate.\\n\\nBuilding types (from `config.py`) and planned Kenney mappings (closest match wins):\\n- `castle` (3x3) → **Castle/Keep**\\n- `palace` (3x3) → **Castle/Keep (variant)** (or reuse castle until variant exists)\\n- `warrior_guild` (2x2) → **Barracks / Guild hall**\\n- `ranger_guild` (2x2) → **Hut/house (archer variant)**\\n- `rogue_guild` (2x2) → **Hut/house (thief variant)**\\n- `wizard_guild` (2x2) → **Mage hut / small tower**\\n- `marketplace` (2x2) → **Market stall / shop**\\n- `blacksmith` (2x2) → **Smithy / workshop**\\n- `inn` (2x2) → **Tavern / inn**\\n- `trading_post` (2x2) → **Shop / trader stall**\\n- `temple_agrela`..`temple_lunord` (3x3) → **Temple/chapel** (initially one shared temple sprite; later variants via palette/roof swaps)\\n- `gnome_hovel` (2x2) → **Cottage (small)**\\n- `elven_bungalow` (2x2) → **Cottage (green/wood)**\\n- `dwarven_settlement` (2x2) → **Stone house / workshop**\\n- `guardhouse` (2x2) → **Guard post / barracks**\\n- `ballista_tower` (1x1) → **Ballista / small tower**\\n- `wizard_tower` (2x2) → **Wizard tower**\\n- `fairgrounds` (3x3) → **Tents / fair area** (placeholder: large tent)\\n- `library` (2x2) → **Library / hall** (placeholder: civic building)\\n- `royal_gardens` (2x2) → **Garden/hedges** (placeholder: decorative greenery tile cluster)\\n- `house` (1x1) → **House**\\n- `farm` (2x2) → **Farm plot/barn**\\n- `food_stand` (1x1) → **Food stall**\\n\\n## Cohesion rules (must follow during ingest)\\n- **Nearest-neighbor only**: no smoothing/filtered scaling.\\n- **32×32 alignment**: if source art is 16×16, scale to 32×32 with nearest-neighbor; keep anchors consistent (feet/ground contact).\\n- **Outline thickness**: standardize to ~1px near-black outline for units/buildings; do not mix outline-free sprites with outlined sprites unless normalized.\\n- **Perspective**: prefer top-down-ish/diagonal consistent with current camera; avoid side-view sprites.\\n- **Value ramps**: favor 3-step ramps; keep world readable under fog-of-war.\\n- **Curate subsets**: do not import entire packs; only ship what maps to the above entity IDs and states.\\n\\n## Commands run (PASS evidence)\\n- PASS: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick`\\n  - Evidence snippet: `[qa_smoke] DONE: PASS`\\n\\n## Blockers\\nNone.

keep tiny.\\n\\n### Minimum state cues\\n- `idle`: bow down/relaxed; subtle bob; feet planted.\\n- `walk`: bow held tighter; one leg forward; maintain silhouette.\\n- `attack`: unique frame with bow drawn and a tiny highlight/spark at bow tip; body lean forward.\\n- `hurt`: one-frame recoil; bow droops; head tilt.\\n- `dead`: collapsed bones + bow separated (bow can be 2–4px off to the side) so it reads as an archer corpse.\\n\\n### Color/material notes (aligned with WK3 target)\\n- Bones: off-white ramp (no pure white) with cool shadow.\\n- Bow: warm brown ramp; keep outline near-black.\\n- Cloth accent: muted red/purple sash (1–3px) to differentiate from melee skeleton without adding noise.\\n\\n## Acceptance criteria to lock (art/pipeline relevant)\\n- Enemy is visually distinguishable at **Z2** from melee skeleton in `enemy_catalog` closeups (bow silhouette reads).\\n- Asset folders exist with at least one PNG:\\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/idle/frame_000.png`\\n  - `.../walk/frame_000.png`\\n  - `.../attack/frame_000.png`\\n  - `.../hurt/frame_000.png`\\n  - `.../dead/frame_000.png`\\n- Visual Snapshot System: `enemy_catalog` produces a closeup PNG for `skeleton_archer` and gallery builds successfully.\\n- Strict validator passes: `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution` (note: if placeholders are first-party/procedural, attribution should not require adding a third-party pack).\\n\\n## Risks + mitigations\\n- **Readability risk**: archer reads too similar to skeleton melee at Z2.\\n  - Mitigation: enforce bow C-curve silhouette + quiver strap + distinct attack pose.\\n- **Noise risk**: over-detailing bones/gear creates shimmer at small size.\\n  - Mitigation: keep to the WK3 noise budget (units low texture; 3-step ramps).\\n- **Pipeline mismatch risk**: plan says “existing generator” but generator naming/path may differ.\\n  - Mitigation: Agent 12 confirms the exact placeholder generator tool (likely `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py`) and ensures it can emit the new enemy frames.\\n\\n## Concrete file touchpoints expected (paths only; no implementation yet)\\n- `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/{idle,walk,attack,hurt,dead}/frame_000.png`\\n- `tools/assets_manifest.json` (add `skeleton_archer` under enemies)\\n- `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` (emit the new frames)\\n- `game/graphics/enemy_sprites.py` (procedural fallback recognition, if needed)\\n- `tools/screenshot_scenarios.py` / `tools/capture_screenshots.py` (enemy_catalog should pick up via manifest)\\n\\n## Questions (blockers only; max 3)\\n1) Can Agent 12 confirm the canonical placeholder generator script name/path we should extend for `skeleton_archer` (plan references an \"existing generator\")?\\n\\n## Next actions\\n- Post this art contract into my agent log (done) so Agents 03/05/11/12 can lock behavior/tunables/tests against a stable sprite expectation.\\n- If PM greenlights Build A implementation, coordinate with Agent 12 to ensure the generator outputs a clear bow/quiver silhouette within the WK3 style contract.\\n",

I understand my role is **art signoff only** for placeholder sprites: verify `skeleton_archer` reads as ranged at 32×32/Z2 via `enemy_catalog` snapshots after implementation lands.\n\n## Context refresh summary\n- **WK3 status**: Closed and shipped (Prototype v1.2.4).\n- **WK4 feature**: New enemy type `skeleton_archer` (ranged kiter), spawned from Skeleton Crypt.\n- **My wk4_r1 deliverable**: Art/readability contract defining bow C-curve silhouette, quiver strap, distinct attack pose, and minimum per-state cues (idle/walk/attack/hurt/dead) at 32×32 consistent with `docs/art/wk3_major_graphics_target.md`.\n\n## Locked Build A decisions (ACK'd)\n- **Ranged-only** in Build A (no melee fallback) — art contract supports this with distinct bow silhouette.\n- **Instant-hit ranged** (no projectile system) — art contract allows sprite-only attack pose with optional tiny spark at bow tip.\n- **Kiting behavior** with distance band — no art impact; behavior-only.\n- **Deterministic 80/20 spawn mix** (skeleton / skeleton_archer) from Skeleton Crypt — no art impact.\n- **Pipeline completeness mandatory**:\n  - Add `skeleton_archer` to `tools/assets_manifest.json`\n  - Generate placeholder PNGs: `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/{idle,walk,attack,hurt,dead}/frame_000.png`\n  - Gates: `qa_smoke --quick`, `validate_assets --strict --check-attribution`, `enemy_catalog` snapshot + gallery build\n\n## Role-specific deliverables (Agent 09)\n- **Art signoff criteria** (from wk4_r1, still valid):\n  - Bow C-curve silhouette obvious at Z2\n  - Quiver/strap cue present (or second clear ranged cue)\n  - Attack pose clearly draw/release (even if instant-hit)\n  - Dead pose includes bow separation for readability\n  - Style compliance: 1px outline, top-left light, subtle baked shadow, low noise\n- **Post-implementation verification** (after Agent 12/Integrator lands changes):\n  - Run `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` (must PASS)\n  - Run `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution` (must PASS)\n  - Run `python tools/capture_screenshots.py --scenario enemy_catalog --seed 3 --out docs/screenshots/wk4_after/enemy_catalog_seed3 --size 1920x1080 --ticks 0` (must produce skeleton_archer closeup PNG)\n  - Run `python tools/build_gallery.py --shots docs/screenshots/wk4_after --refs .cursor/plans/art_examples --out docs/art/compare_gallery.html` (must build browsable gallery)\n  - Visual review: skeleton_archer is clearly ranged and distinct from melee skeleton in enemy_catalog closeup at Z2\n\n## Blockers (none)\n- No blockers preventing Build A implementation.\n- Art contract from wk4_r1 is stable and ready for implementation.\n- Placeholder generator path confirmed: `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` (Agent 12 owns this).\n\n## Expected file touchpoints (paths only; no code yet)\n- **Placeholder sprites** (generated by Agent 12):\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/idle/frame_000.png`\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/walk/frame_000.png`\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/attack/frame_000.png`\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/hurt/frame_000.png`\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/dead/frame_000.png`\n- **Manifest** (Agent 12):\n  - `tools/assets_manifest.json` (add `skeleton_archer` under enemies)\n- **Generator** (Agent 12):\n  - `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` (emit skeleton_archer frames)\n- **Graphics fallback** (if needed, Agent 12 or implementer):\n  - `game/graphics/enemy_sprites.py` (procedural fallback recognition)\n- **Snapshot system** (Agent 12, already manifest-driven):\n  - `tools/screenshot_scenarios.py` / `tools/capture_screenshots.py` (enemy_catalog auto-includes via manifest)\n- **Agent 09 log** (this file):\n  - `.cursor/plans/agent_logs/agent_09_ArtDirector_Pixel_Animation_VFX.json` (signoff evidence)\n\n## Risks + mitigations (art/pipeline only)\n- **Readability risk**: skeleton_archer reads too similar to melee skeleton at Z2.\n  - **Mitigation**: Enforce strong bow C-curve silhouette + quiver strap + distinct attack pose (already in art contract). If snapshots show confusion, request smallest sprite-only tweak (stronger bow/quiver/pose) as Build A clarity safeguard.\n- **Noise risk**: Over-texturing causes shimmer/noise at 32×32.\n  - **Mitigation**: Keep to WK3 noise budget (3-step ramps, low unit texture, minimal interior linework). Placeholder generator must respect this.\n- **Pipeline mismatch risk**: Placeholder generator may not emit bow/quiver silhouette clearly.\n  - **Mitigation**: Coordinate with Agent 12 to ensure generator outputs clear bow C-curve and quiver strap within WK3 style contract. If generator cannot produce readable silhouette, request manual sprite adjustment (still procedural/first-party, no attribution needed).\n\n## Questions (blockers only; max 3)\nNone. Art contract is stable and ready for implementation.\n\n## Next actions\n- Wait for Agent 12/Integrator to land manifest + placeholder PNG generation + snapshot run.\n- After implementation, run the 4 required commands and post PASS/FAIL evidence + screenshot filename(s) checked.\n- If readability fails at Z2, report concrete art blocker (what cue is missing and which sprite/action frame to adjust) without proposing new systems.\n",

All specs align with `docs/art/wk3_major_graphics_target.md` style contract.\n\n## Deliverables\n- **Ranger attack sprite brief**: Bow silhouette + draw/release pose cues for 32×32 readability\n- **Projectile VFX spec**: 1-2 px arrow/bolt design with palette, outline, contrast rules\n- **Worker sprite briefs**: Peasant + TaxCollector silhouettes (idle/walk/work/collect states)\n- **Animation frame guidance**: Minimal Build A requirements (frame_000.png acceptable for initial pass)\n\n## Files I will touch\n- This log entry: `.cursor/plans/agent_logs/agent_09_ArtDirector_Pixel_Animation_VFX.json`\n- Optional doc update: `docs/art/placeholder_sprite_briefs.md` (extend with worker briefs)\n\n## 1) Ranger \"shooting a bow\" sprite brief\n\n### Current state\n- Ranger uses procedural fallback if no PNGs exist (green circle + \"R\" glyph)\n- Existing brief in `docs/art/placeholder_sprite_briefs.md`: \"hood + bow profile (bow must read)\", \"draw → release (strong 1-frame 'release' pose)\"\n\n### WK5 requirements (Build A)\n**Attack frame (`frame_000.png` minimum for Build A):**\n- **Bow silhouette**: Strong C-curve or diagonal bow shape (not a straight stick)\n  - Position: held diagonally across body (top-left to bottom-right or vice versa)\n  - Size: bow should span ~12-16 px to be obvious at 32×32\n  - Outline: 1px near-black outline (`#141419`) on bow\n- **Draw/release pose**:\n  - Body lean: slight backward lean (anticipation) OR forward lean (release)\n  - Arm position: one arm extended (bow hand), other arm drawn back (string hand)\n  - Optional: tiny highlight pixel at bow tip (arrow notch cue)\n- **Style compliance**:\n  - Top-left lighting (subtle highlight on bow top edge)\n  - 3-step palette ramp for bow (dark/mid/light wood or composite)\n  - Low texture (bow is a clean shape, not detailed)\n  - Subtle ground shadow ellipse\n\n**Idle/walk frames (if extending beyond frame_000):**\n- Bow held diagonally across body (readable silhouette)\n- Optional quiver cue: small back block + diagonal strap (2-3 px)\n- Cloak flutter in walk (green cloak per existing spec)\n\n### Readability test\nAt gameplay zoom (Z2), ranger attack frame should read as \"archer shooting\" even without projectile visible. Bow C-curve must be unmistakable.\n\n## 2) Arrow/bolt projectile VFX spec (1-2 px)\n\n### Design constraints\n- **Size**: 1-2 px (strict; matches pixel grid discipline)\n- **Lifetime**: 80-140ms travel time (per plan)\n- **Deterministic**: seeded RNG for any jitter (not wall-clock)\n- **Visual-only**: no physics/collision (per plan)\n\n### Palette + outline rules\n**Arrow (ranger/skeleton_archer):**\n- **Core color**: warm wood brown (`#8B4513` or `#A0522D`)\n- **Tip highlight**: bright near-white pixel (`#F5F5F5`) at leading edge\n- **Outline**: 1px near-black (`#141419`) on trailing edge only (avoid doubling outline with background)\n- **Optional fletching cue**: 1px darker brown (`#654321`) at trailing edge\n\n**Bolt (future crossbow/magic):**\n- **Core color**: steel grey (`#708090` or `#778899`)\n- **Tip highlight**: bright silver (`#E0E0E0`)\n- **Outline**: same as arrow (trailing edge only)\n\n### Contrast + readability\n- **Background contrast**: Arrow must read on grass (`#228B22`), path (`#8B7765`), and water\n  - Wood brown provides sufficient contrast against green grass\n  - Bright tip pixel ensures visibility on dark backgrounds\n- **Motion blur avoidance**: No trailing/streak effects (keep it crisp 1-2 px)\n- **Direction cue**: Arrow should point in travel direction (diagonal line or L-shape for 2px)\n\n### VFX integration notes\n- Extend `game/graphics/vfx.py` with `ProjectileVFX` class (separate from particle bursts)\n- Render as simple pixel rects (no alpha blending for crispness, per existing VFX style)\n- Position: interpolate from `from_x, from_y` to `to_x, to_y` over lifetime\n- Optional: tiny spark pixel at impact point (reuse existing hit particle system)\n\n## 3) Worker sprite briefs (Peasant + TaxCollector)\n\n### Folder structure\n- `assets/sprites/workers/peasant/{idle,walk,work,hurt,dead}/frame_000.png`\n- `assets/sprites/workers/tax_collector/{idle,walk,collect,return}/frame_000.png`\n\n### Peasant silhouette (32×32)\n**Readability at Z2:**\n- **Body shape**: Simple humanoid (head + torso + legs)\n  - Head: 6-8 px circle/ellipse\n  - Torso: 8-10 px tall, 6-8 px wide (slightly wider than ranger for \"worker\" feel)\n  - Legs: 10-12 px tall, 4-5 px wide each\n- **Distinctive cues**:\n  - Tool/implement held (hammer, shovel, or pickaxe silhouette)\n  - Simple work clothes (no armor; softer silhouette than heroes)\n  - Optional: small satchel/backpack (2-3 px block)\n- **Palette**:\n  - Clothes: muted brown/beige (`#8B7355` or `#A0826D`)\n  - Skin: warm tone (`#D2B48C` or `#DEB887`)\n  - Tool: darker brown/steel (`#654321` or `#708090`)\n- **States**:\n  - `idle`: standing, tool at side\n  - `walk`: tool held, clear step cycle\n  - `work`: tool raised/forward (construction/repair pose)\n  - `hurt`: flinch pose (quick recoil)\n  - `dead`: collapsed pose (distinct from alive)\n\n### TaxCollector silhouette (32×32)\n**Readability at Z2:**\n- **Body shape**: Similar to peasant but distinct\n  - Head: 6-8 px (same as peasant)\n  - Torso: slightly more upright/formal (8-10 px)\n  - Legs: same proportions as peasant\n- **Distinctive cues**:\n  - **Coin bag/pouch**: visible at waist or held (3-4 px block, gold highlight `#FFD700`)\n  - **Formal attire**: slightly more structured silhouette (coat/jacket vs work clothes)\n  - **Optional**: small ledger/scroll (2 px) in hand for `collect` state\n- **Palette**:\n  - Clothes: richer brown/gold trim (`#8B6914` or `#A0826D` with gold accent)\n  - Coin bag: bright gold (`#FFD700`) with dark outline\n  - Skin: same warm tone as peasant\n- **States**:\n  - `idle`: standing, coin bag visible\n  - `walk`: coin bag at side, clear step cycle\n  - `collect`: coin bag held forward (collection pose)\n  - `return`: coin bag held, walking toward castle\n\n### Style compliance (both workers)\n- **Lighting**: Top-left (subtle highlight on top/left edges)\n- **Outline**: 1px near-black (`#141419`), selective (lighten on top/left edges)\n- **Shadow**: Subtle ground shadow ellipse (low opacity, cool near-black)\n- **Noise budget**: Low texture (silhouette + 2-3 high-signal pixels: tool/coin bag/head)\n- **3-step ramps**: Use for clothes/tool (shadow/mid/highlight with hue shift)\n\n## 4) Animation frame guidance (Build A minimum)\n\n### Build A acceptable\n- **Single frame per state** (`frame_000.png`) is acceptable for Build A\n- Engine will loop `idle`/`walk` and play `attack`/`work`/`collect` as single-frame animations\n- This unblocks pipeline and allows visual snapshot validation\n\n### Build B polish (optional)\n- **Peasant walk**: 4-6 frames (clear step cycle)\n- **Peasant work**: 3-4 frames (tool raise → strike → recover)\n- **TaxCollector collect**: 2-3 frames (reach → collect → hold)\n- **Ranger attack**: 4-6 frames (draw → release → recover) if not already present\n\n## Risks + mitigations\n\n### Ranger bow readability\n- **Risk**: Bow silhouette too subtle at 32×32, reads as \"stick\" or \"staff\"\n  - **Mitigation**: Enforce strong C-curve (12-16 px span), diagonal orientation, bright tip highlight\n- **Risk**: Attack pose confusable with melee (sword swing)\n  - **Mitigation**: Distinct draw/release pose (backward lean + extended arm), bow held diagonally\n\n### Projectile visibility\n- **Risk**: 1-2 px arrow lost on noisy terrain (grass/path)\n  - **Mitigation**: Bright tip pixel (`#F5F5F5`), warm wood brown contrasts with green grass, trailing edge outline\n- **Risk**: Arrow direction unclear (which way is it traveling?)\n  - **Mitigation**: Pointed shape (diagonal line or L-shape for 2px), bright tip at leading edge\n\n### Worker silhouette confusion\n- **Risk**: Peasant and TaxCollector look too similar at Z2\n  - **Mitigation**: Strong distinctive cues (tool vs coin bag), different palette (muted work clothes vs gold accent)\n- **Risk**: Workers confusable with heroes (ranger/rogue)\n  - **Mitigation**: Softer silhouette (no armor), tool/coin bag cues, muted palette vs hero bright colors\n\n### Style contract compliance\n- **Risk**: Over-texturing causes shimmer at 32×32\n  - **Mitigation**: Enforce low noise budget (silhouette + 2-3 high-signal pixels), 3-step ramps only\n- **Risk**: Inconsistent lighting/shadow breaks cohesion\n  - **Mitigation**: Reference `wk3_major_graphics_target.md` golden palette, top-left light, subtle shadow ellipse\n\n## Dependencies\n- **Agent 12**: Add workers category to `tools/assets_manifest.json` and extend `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` to emit worker frames\n- **Agent 03/05**: Define ranged attacker interface (`is_ranged_attacker` or `get_ranged_spec()`) so combat system can emit projectile events\n- **Agent 08**: Confirm worker states match UI/behavior expectations (peasant `work` vs `idle`/`walk`, tax collector `collect` vs `return`)\n\n## Questions (blockers only; max 3)\n1) **Ranger attack frames**: Do we have existing ranger attack PNGs, or should placeholder generator emit bow silhouette? If existing, should I review them for bow readability before WK5 implementation?\n2) **Projectile color variation**: Should different ranged attackers (ranger vs skeleton_archer) use different arrow colors, or same wood brown for consistency? (Recommendation: same color for Build A, add variation in Build B if needed)\n3) **Worker state alignment**: Confirm `tax_collector` states match behavior: `idle`, `walk`, `collect` (at guild), `return` (to castle). Is `hurt`/`dead` needed for tax collector, or only for peasant?\n\n## Next actions\n- Wait for Agent 12 to confirm placeholder generator can emit ranger bow silhouette + worker frames\n- After implementation, verify ranger attack reads as \"bow shooting\" in Visual Snapshot System (ranged projectile showcase scenario)\n- Review worker sprites in snapshot gallery to confirm distinct silhouettes (peasant tool vs tax collector coin bag)\n- If readability fails, provide smallest sprite-only tweaks (stronger bow C-curve, brighter projectile tip, more distinct worker cues)\n",

Bow C-curve must be unmistakable (not a stick, not a staff, clearly a bow).\n\n## Risks + mitigations\n\n### Arrow color consistency\n- **Risk**: All ranged attackers look identical (no visual differentiation)\n  - **Mitigation**: Acceptable for Build A (consistency > variation). Add color variation in Build B if needed (steel bolts, magic projectiles)\n\n### Tax collector state gaps\n- **Risk**: If tax collector becomes attackable in future, missing hurt/dead frames\n  - **Mitigation**: Document that hurt/dead are \"peasant-only\" for Build A. If tax collector becomes combat-relevant, add states in future sprint\n\n### Bow readability in placeholder\n- **Risk**: Placeholder generator produces weak bow silhouette (too subtle, reads as stick)\n  - **Mitigation**: Enforce minimum 12 px span, diagonal orientation, bright tip highlight. If generator cannot produce readable bow, request manual sprite adjustment (still procedural/first-party, no attribution needed)\n\n## Dependencies\n- **Agent 12**: Update `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` to emit ranger attack frame with bow C-curve (12-16 px span, diagonal, bright tip highlight)\n- **Agent 05**: Confirm ranged attacker inventory (ranger + skeleton_archer + ballista_tower) so VFX system can apply same arrow color to all\n- **Agent 03**: Ensure projectile event contract includes `projectile_kind` field (even if all use \"arrow\" in Build A) for future Build B differentiation\n\n## Questions (blockers only; max 3)\nNone. All art decisions finalized for Build A.\n\n## Next actions\n- Wait for Agent 12 to confirm placeholder generator can emit ranger attack frame with bow C-curve + tip highlight\n- After implementation, verify ranger attack reads as \"bow shooting\" in Visual Snapshot System (ranged projectile showcase scenario)\n- If bow readability fails, provide smallest sprite-only tweak (stronger C-curve span, brighter tip, more diagonal orientation)\n",

I will verify that Agent 12's placeholder generator updates produce sprites meeting the art contract from wk5_r1/r2, then run validation commands and review snapshots.\n\n## Deliverables\n- **Worker sprite verification**: Confirm peasant + tax_collector placeholders meet silhouette requirements (tool vs coin bag cues, distinct palettes)\n- **Ranger bow cue verification**: Ensure ranger attack frame includes bow C-curve (12-16 px span, diagonal, bright tip highlight) per wk5_r2 spec\n- **Arrow color consistency confirmation**: Verify all ranged attackers use same warm wood brown arrow (ranger + skeleton_archer)\n- **Visual signoff evidence**: Run validation commands, review snapshots, provide PASS/FAIL evidence\n\n## Files I will touch\n- This log entry: `.cursor/plans/agent_logs/agent_09_ArtDirector_Pixel_Animation_VFX.json`\n- No code changes (verification/signoff only)\n\n## Dependencies (waiting on)\n- **Agent 12**: Update `tools/assets_manifest.json` (add workers category), extend `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` (worker frames + ranger bow cue), run generator\n- **Agent 03/05**: Implement ranged projectile events and VFX system (for arrow color verification)\n- **Agent 12**: Add Visual Snapshot scenarios (worker_catalog + ranged_projectiles)\n\n## Verification checklist (after dependencies land)\n\n### 1) Worker sprites (peasant + tax_collector)\n**Expected paths:**\n- `assets/sprites/workers/peasant/{idle,walk,work,hurt,dead}/frame_000.png`\n- `assets/sprites/workers/tax_collector/{idle,walk,collect,return}/frame_000.png`\n\n**Art contract checks:**\n- Peasant: Tool/implement visible (hammer/shovel/pickaxe silhouette), muted brown/beige palette\n- TaxCollector: Coin bag/pouch visible (3-4 px, gold #FFD700), richer brown/gold trim\n- Both: Distinct silhouettes at 32×32, top-left lighting, 1px selective outline, low texture\n- States: Peasant has hurt/dead; TaxCollector does NOT have hurt/dead (per wk5_r2 decision)\n\n### 2) Ranger attack bow cue\n**Expected path:**\n- `assets/sprites/heroes/ranger/attack/frame_000.png` (or regenerated by placeholder generator)\n\n**Art contract checks (wk5_r2 must-haves):**\n- Bow C-curve: Minimum 12 px span (target 14-16 px), diagonal orientation\n- Tip highlight: 1 px bright pixel (#F5F5F5) at leading edge\n- Outline: 1 px near-black (#141419) around bow\n- Body pose: Extended arm + drawn-back arm (draw/release cue)\n- Readability: At Z2 gameplay zoom, reads as \"archer shooting\" (bow unmistakable, not stick/staff)\n\n### 3) Arrow color consistency\n**Verification method:**\n- Review VFX system implementation (game/graphics/vfx.py) to confirm all ranged attackers use same warm wood brown (#8B4513 or #A0522D)\n- Check projectile event contract to ensure no color differentiation in Build A\n- Visual check in ranged_projectiles snapshot: all arrows same color\n\n## How I will test\n\n### Step 1: Verify placeholder generation\nAfter Agent 12 updates generator:\n1. Run `python tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py`\n2. Check worker sprites exist and meet art contract (visual inspection of PNGs)\n3. Check ranger attack frame includes bow cue (visual inspection)\n\n### Step 2: Run validation gates\n1. `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` (must PASS)\n2. `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution` (must PASS)\n\n### Step 3: Visual snapshot review\nAfter Agent 12 adds scenarios:\n1. `python tools/capture_screenshots.py --scenario worker_catalog --seed 3 --out docs/screenshots/wk5_after/worker_catalog_seed3 --size 1920x1080 --ticks 0`\n2. `python tools/capture_screenshots.py --scenario ranged_projectiles --seed 3 --out docs/screenshots/wk5_after/ranged_projectiles_seed3 --size 1920x1080 --ticks 60`\n3. `python tools/capture_screenshots.py --scenario ranged_projectiles --seed 3 --out docs/screenshots/wk5_after/ranged_projectiles_seed3 --size 1920x1080 --ticks 90`\n4. `python tools/capture_screenshots.py --scenario ranged_projectiles --seed 3 --out docs/screenshots/wk5_after/ranged_projectiles_seed3 --size 1920x1080 --ticks 120`\n5. `python tools/build_gallery.py --shots docs/screenshots/wk5_after --refs .cursor/plans/art_examples --out docs/art/compare_gallery.html`\n6. Review gallery: worker sprites distinct (tool vs coin bag), ranger bow readable, arrows same color, projectiles visible at mid-flight (ticks 60/90/120)\n\n## Execution lock-ins (acknowledged)\n- **Demolish rules**: Allowed under attack, disabled under construction (no art impact, gameplay-only)\n- **Projectiles**: Visual-only (no collision/physics) — art verification focuses on visual readability only\n- **Snapshot ticks**: Use ticks 60/90/120 for ranged_projectiles scenario to capture projectiles at mid-flight\n- **Gates**: Must stay green — `qa_smoke --quick` and `validate_assets --strict --check-attribution` must PASS\n\n## Risks + mitigations\n\n### Worker sprite readability\n- **Risk**: Peasant and TaxCollector look too similar at Z2\n  - **Mitigation**: Verify strong distinctive cues (tool vs coin bag), different palettes (muted work clothes vs gold accent)\n- **Risk**: Tool/coin bag too subtle at 32×32\n  - **Mitigation**: Enforce minimum size (tool 6-8 px, coin bag 3-4 px), bright gold highlight for coin bag\n\n### Ranger bow readability\n- **Risk**: Bow C-curve too subtle, reads as stick/staff\n  - **Mitigation**: Verify minimum 12 px span, diagonal orientation, bright tip highlight (#F5F5F5)\n- **Risk**: Attack pose confusable with melee (sword swing)\n  - **Mitigation**: Verify distinct draw/release pose (backward lean + extended arm), bow held diagonally\n\n### Arrow color inconsistency\n- **Risk**: Different ranged attackers use different arrow colors (breaks Build A consistency)\n  - **Mitigation**: Review VFX system code, verify all use same warm wood brown, check snapshot for visual consistency\n\n## Confirmations (locked for Build A implementation)\n\n### 1) Arrow/bolt palette defaults — CONFIRMED\n**Decision**: Same warm wood brown for all ranged attackers in Build A\n- **Color**: Warm wood brown `#8B4513` (SaddleBrown) or `#A0522D` (Sienna)\n- **Applies to**: Ranger, SkeletonArcher, future BallistaTower\n- **Tip highlight**: Bright near-white pixel `#F5F5F5` at leading edge (for visibility on dark backgrounds)\n- **Outline**: 1 px near-black `#141419` on trailing edge only\n- **Rationale**: Consistency, readability, pipeline simplicity (per wk5_r2 decision)\n- **Build B note**: Can add color variation (steel bolts, magic projectiles) without breaking existing visuals\n\n### 2) Ranger bow silhouette cues — CONFIRMED\n**Must-have pixels for placeholder generator:**\n- **Bow C-curve**: Minimum 12 px span (target 14-16 px), diagonal orientation (top-left to bottom-right or vice versa)\n- **Tip highlight**: 1 px bright pixel `#F5F5F5` at leading edge of bow\n- **Outline**: 1 px near-black `#141419` around bow (selective: lighten on top/left edges per WK3 style)\n- **Body pose**: Extended arm (bow hand) + drawn-back arm (string hand), slight backward lean (anticipation) or forward lean (release)\n- **Readability test**: At Z2 gameplay zoom, ranger attack frame must read as \"archer shooting\" (bow unmistakable, not stick/staff)\n\n### 3) Tax collector hurt/dead states — CONFIRMED\n**Decision**: Tax collector does NOT need hurt/dead frames in Build A\n- **Rationale**: Tax collectors are non-combat NPCs (no enemy targeting, no combat interactions)\n- **Confirmed states**: `idle`, `walk`, `collect`, `return` only\n- **Peasant states** (unchanged): `idle`, `walk`, `work`, `hurt`, `dead` (peasant is attackable, needs combat states)\n- **Future-proofing**: If tax collector becomes attackable in future sprint, add hurt/dead states then\n\n## Final confirmations for Build A implementation\n\n### 1) Arrow/bolt palette defaults — FINAL CONFIRMATION\n**Locked for Build A:**\n- **Color**: Warm wood brown `#8B4513` (SaddleBrown) or `#A0522D` (Sienna)\n- **Applies to**: All ranged attackers (Ranger, SkeletonArcher, future BallistaTower)\n- **Tip highlight**: Bright near-white pixel `#F5F5F5` at leading edge\n- **Outline**: 1 px near-black `#141419` on trailing edge only\n- **No color differentiation in Build A** (consistency > variation)\n\n### 2) Ranger bow silhouette cues — FINAL CONFIRMATION\n**Must-have pixels for placeholder generator (locked):**\n- **Bow C-curve**: Minimum 12 px span (target 14-16 px), diagonal orientation\n- **Tip highlight**: 1 px bright pixel `#F5F5F5` at leading edge of bow\n- **Outline**: 1 px near-black `#141419` around bow (selective: lighten on top/left edges)\n- **Body pose**: Extended arm (bow hand) + drawn-back arm (string hand), draw/release cue\n- **Readability**: At Z2 gameplay zoom, must read as \"archer shooting\" (bow unmistakable)\n\n### 3) Tax collector hurt/dead need — FINAL CONFIRMATION\n**Gameplay decision**: Tax collectors do NOT need hurt/dead states\n- **Rationale**: Tax collectors are non-combat NPCs (no enemy targeting, no combat interactions)\n- **Gameplay impact**: None (tax collectors never enter combat)\n- **Validator impact**: Tax collectors should NOT have hurt/dead in manifest or asset paths\n- **Confirmed states**: `idle`, `walk`, `collect`, `return` only\n- **Peasant states** (unchanged): `idle`, `walk`, `work`, `hurt`, `dead` (peasant is attackable)\n- **Validator note**: If validator enforces per-type state lists, tax_collector should explicitly exclude hurt/dead\n\n## Questions (blockers only; max 3)\nNone. All art decisions confirmed and locked for Build A implementation.\n\n## Next actions\n- Wait for Agent 12 to update `tools/assets_manifest.json` (add workers) and `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` (worker frames + ranger bow cue)\n- After generator updates, run `python tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` and verify worker sprites + ranger bow cue\n- Run validation gates: `qa_smoke --quick` and `validate_assets --strict --check-attribution`\n- After Visual Snapshot scenarios added, run snapshot commands and review gallery\n- If readability fails, report concrete art blockers (what cue is missing, which sprite/action frame to adjust)\n",

Projectiles render as 1-2 px arrows/bolts with warm wood brown color and bright tip pixel, meeting the art contract from wk5_r1/r2. Arrow color policy confirmed: all ranged attackers use same warm wood brown in Build A.\n\n## Deliverables (completed)\n- **Projectile rendering implementation**: Added `ProjectileVFX` dataclass and rendering logic in `VFXSystem`\n- **Arrow color policy confirmed**: All ranged attackers use same warm wood brown (#8B4513 = 139, 69, 19) in Build A\n- **Visual readability**: 1-2 px projectiles with bright tip pixel (#F5F5F5) for visibility at Z2 gameplay zoom\n\n## Files changed\n- `game/graphics/vfx.py`: Added `ProjectileVFX` dataclass, `_spawn_projectile()` method, projectile update/render logic\n\n## Implementation details\n\n### ProjectileVFX dataclass\n- Tracks projectile position (interpolated from source to target), progress (0.0 to 1.0), lifetime (80-140ms), age, color, tip color, size\n- Deterministic spawn: seeded RNG from event fields (not wall-clock)\n- Visual-only: no physics/collision, pure visual feedback\n\n### _spawn_projectile() method\n- **Lifetime**: 80-140ms (0.08-0.14 seconds) with deterministic jitter from seeded RNG\n- **Color**: Always warm wood brown (139, 69, 19) for Build A consistency (overrides any provided color)\n- **Tip color**: Bright near-white (245, 245, 245 = #F5F5F5) for visibility on dark backgrounds\n- **Size**: Clamped to 1-2 px (strict pixel grid discipline)\n- **Deterministic seed**: `(int(from_x) << 16) ^ int(from_y) ^ (int(to_x) << 8) ^ int(to_y) ^ 0x4A2B`\n\n### Projectile update logic\n- Updates projectile age and progress (0.0 to 1.0 based on age/lifetime)\n- Removes expired projectiles (age >= lifetime)\n- No physics: projectiles interpolate linearly from source to target\n\n### Projectile render logic\n- Interpolates position from source to target based on progress\n- For 1 px: renders single bright tip pixel at current position\n- For 2 px: renders bright tip pixel at leading edge + wood brown shaft pixel at trailing edge\n- Direction-aware: calculates direction vector for proper tip orientation\n- Pixel-crisp: no alpha blending, uses `pygame.draw.rect()` for crisp 1-2 px rendering\n\n### Event handling\n- `emit_from_events()` now handles `\"ranged_projectile\"` events\n- Extracts `from_x/y`, `to_x/y`, `projectile_kind`, `color`, `size_px` from event\n- Calls `_spawn_projectile()` with event data\n\n## Arrow color policy confirmation\n**Locked for Build A:**\n- **Color**: Warm wood brown `#8B4513` (SaddleBrown = 139, 69, 19)\n- **Applies to**: All ranged attackers (Ranger, SkeletonArcher, future BallistaTower)\n- **Implementation**: VFX system always uses wood brown, overriding any color passed in event (ensures consistency)\n- **Tip highlight**: Bright near-white `#F5F5F5` (245, 245, 245) at leading edge\n- **Rationale**: Consistency, readability, pipeline simplicity (per wk5_r2 decision)\n\n## Visual readability at Z2\n**Projectile design ensures readability:**\n- **Size**: 1-2 px (strict pixel grid discipline, no subpixel rendering)\n- **Color contrast**: Warm wood brown (139, 69, 19) contrasts well with green grass (#228B22), brown path (#8B7765), and water\n- **Tip highlight**: Bright near-white tip pixel ensures visibility on dark backgrounds\n- **Direction cue**: Tip pixel at leading edge provides clear travel direction\n- **Lifetime**: 80-140ms ensures projectiles are visible long enough to read but short enough to avoid clutter\n\n## Testing\n**Commands to run (after Agent 11 runs snapshots):**\n- Visual inspection of `ranged_projectiles` snapshots at ticks 60/90/120\n- Verify projectiles are visible and readable at Z2 gameplay zoom\n- Verify all projectiles use same wood brown color (ranger + skeleton_archer)\n- Verify bright tip pixels are visible on dark backgrounds\n\n## Risks + mitigations\n- **Risk**: Projectiles too small to see at Z2\n  - **Mitigation**: Bright tip pixel (#F5F5F5) ensures visibility; 1-2 px is appropriate for 32×32 tile scale\n- **Risk**: Projectiles lost on noisy terrain (grass/path)\n  - **Mitigation**: Wood brown contrasts with green grass; bright tip ensures visibility on dark backgrounds\n- **Risk**: Color inconsistency if combat system passes different colors\n  - **Mitigation**: VFX system always overrides with wood brown, ensuring consistency regardless of event color\n\n## Dependencies\n- **Agent 03**: Ensure enemy-side ranged projectile event emission for SkeletonArcher (if not already implemented)\n- **Agent 11**: Run snapshots at ticks 60/90/120 and verify projectile visibility/readability\n\n## Questions (blockers only; max 3)\nNone. Implementation complete; ready for visual verification via snapshots.\n\n## Build A completion evidence\n\n### Gates PASSED\n1. **`python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick`** — ✅ PASS\n   - Exit code: 0\n   - All scenarios passed: determinism_guard, base, bounty, hero_stuck_repro, no-enemies, mock-LLM\n   - Output: `[qa_smoke] DONE: PASS`\n\n2. **`python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution`** — ✅ PASS\n   - Exit code: 0\n   - No errors or warnings\n   - All assets validated (heroes, enemies, buildings, workers if present)\n\n### Implementation summary\n- **VFX projectile rendering**: ✅ Implemented in `game/graphics/vfx.py`\n  - `ProjectileVFX` dataclass added\n  - `_spawn_projectile()` method implemented\n  - Projectile update/render logic integrated\n  - Handles `ranged_projectile` events from both hero and enemy attacks\n\n- **Arrow color policy**: ✅ Confirmed and enforced\n  - All ranged attackers use same warm wood brown (#8B4513 = 139, 69, 19)\n  - VFX system overrides event color for Build A consistency\n  - Bright tip pixel (#F5F5F5) for visibility at Z2\n\n- **Enemy projectiles**: ✅ Confirmed implemented\n  - Enemy projectile events created in `enemy.do_attack()` (line 339)\n  - Engine collects and merges with combat events (lines 808-812, 840)\n  - VFX system handles both hero and enemy projectiles\n\n### Visual verification (pending Agent 11)\n- **Snapshots**: Awaiting Agent 11 to run `ranged_projectiles` scenario at ticks 60/90/120\n- **Ranger bow cue**: Awaiting Agent 12 placeholder generator update to verify bow C-curve in ranger attack frame\n- **Worker sprites**: Awaiting Agent 12 placeholder generator update to verify worker sprites (peasant + tax_collector)\n\n## Next actions\n- ✅ Build A implementation complete for Agent 09 scope (VFX projectile rendering)\n- ⏳ Wait for Agent 11 to run snapshots and provide visual evidence\n- ⏳ Wait for Agent 12 to update placeholder generator (ranger bow cue + worker sprites)\n- After snapshots available, review `ranged_projectiles` snapshots at ticks 60/90/120 to confirm readability at Z2\n- If readability fails, adjust tip pixel brightness or projectile size (still within 1-2 px constraint)\n",

UI polish handled by Agent 08 in parallel.\n\n## Recommended next actions\n- Start with terrain + paths (highest ROI, low risk) using procedural sprite tweaks.\n- Then update tier-1 building sprites in-place (no footprint change).\n- Finish with unit readability pass and optional fog edge polish.\n",
