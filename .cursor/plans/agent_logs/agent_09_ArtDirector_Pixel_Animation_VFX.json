(I can create assets regardless; integration validation depends on the finalized contract.)\\n\\n## Recommended next actions\\n- Wait for Agent 3 contracts regarding inside-building + any animation-state signals before suggesting any engine-side state mapping tweaks.\\n- Begin producing the 4-class sprite set in the specified folder structure (Build B).\\n- Coordinate with Tools/QA only via their published harness: adopt their deterministic scenario for quick visual verification once it exists.\\n",

Round 1 deliverable is **art direction + asset conventions** (not a big implementation dump): define a cohesive UI skin direction (Majesty-like) and a safe plan for ingesting CC0/open-license pixel art with clean attribution while keeping `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` green.\\n\\n## Deliverables (Round 1 outputs)\\n- UI art direction constraints (palette/value, outlines, 9-slice style, icon readability) suitable for 1080p UI.\\n- Asset conventions for sprite ingestion (heroes/enemies/buildings) and UI icon/sheet usage without breaking pixel integrity.\\n- Acceptance criteria + test gates for Build A (UI + borderless) and Build B (asset ingestion).\\n\\n## Proposed changes (file boundaries; Round 1 = plan/spec only)\\n- Docs (safe, low-conflict):\\n  - Extend `docs/art/pixel_style_guide.md` with a short UI-skin section (panel materials, value ramps, outline rules).\\n  - Add `docs/art/ui_skin_style_guide.md` describing: 1080p UI scale targets, 9-slice padding rules, button states, and icon sizes (16/20/24 px).\\n- Assets (Build B, larger change):\\n  - Populate existing sprite override directories:\\n    - `assets/sprites/heroes/<class>/<action>/*.png`\\n    - `assets/sprites/enemies/<type>/<action>/*.png`\\n    - `assets/sprites/buildings/<type>/<state>/*.png`\\n  - UI sprites (optional; Build B): `assets/sprites/ui/` for icon PNGs if we move beyond procedural icons.\\n  - Attribution structure (expected, but owned by Tools/Ops): `assets/ATTRIBUTION.md` + `assets/third_party/<pack_name>/...`\\n\\n## Art direction (UI + sprites)\\n### 1) UI skin (Majesty-inspired, modern readable)\\n- **Value-first readability**: panels should be darker than world; text/icons high-value with 1px outline or shadow.\\n- **Materials**: carved wood + parchment + metal trims; avoid pure black/white.\\n- **9-slice panels**: corners must remain crisp; avoid gradients that band at 1080p.\\n- **Iconography**: prefer silhouette icons over text for bottom command bar; keep icon sizes consistent (recommended 20px) with a 1px outline and a dark plate for world-overlays.\\n- **State language**: hover/pressed/disabled should be readable with 2–3 value steps, not just hue shift.\\n\\n### 2) Sprite ingestion coherence\\n- Keep sprites **32x32 aligned** (or deterministically scaled to that); no smoothing/filtered scaling.\\n- Maintain class color accents consistent with existing placeholder language (Warrior=blue, Ranger=green, Rogue=desat steel/gray, Wizard=purple).\\n- Prefer packs with consistent outline thickness and ramp style; if mixed packs are unavoidable, normalize via palette/value adjustments.\\n\\n## Acceptance criteria + gates\\n### Build A (Midweek): borderless 1920x1080 + UI skeleton (no new art dependency)\\n- Default launch is **borderless 1920×1080**, or **borderless at native display resolution** if smaller.\\n- UI layout is readable at 1080p (no overlaps; text not clipped; minimap/panels fit).\\n- `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` remains PASS.\\n- Manual smoke (10 min) in both:\\n  - `python main.py --no-llm`\\n  - `python main.py --provider mock`\\n\\n### Build B (Endweek): pixel art for everything visible + attribution\\n- Heroes/enemies/buildings use pixel sprites when assets exist; procedural fallback OK for missing frames.\\n- Attribution is complete and clean (human-readable + verbatim license text preserved).\\n- No regressions: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` PASS.\\n\\n## Exact test commands (what I will treat as gates)\\n- Required: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick`\\n- Required manual: `python main.py --no-llm` and `python main.py --provider mock`\\n- Asset presence validation: to be added by Tools/QA (Agent 12/11) as a script; I will not guess the final command name.\\n\\n## Risks\\n- Mixed-pack art style drift (different outlines/palettes) makes the game feel inconsistent; mitigate by choosing one primary pack per category or normalizing ramps.\\n- UI scaling conflicts: if borderless+scaling strategy changes later, UI art sizing could thrash; mitigate by waiting for Agent 3’s locked scaling contract before producing UI sheet pixel sizes beyond icons.\\n- Repo size bloat: large CC0 packs can balloon repo; mitigate by selecting minimal subsets and documenting source packs in `assets/third_party/`.\\n\\n## Dependencies (blockers only)\\n- Agent 3 contract decision: final window scaling / UI scale strategy (so UI art can be authored at the correct pixel scale).\\n- Agent 12 + Agent 13 conventions: final attribution folder/file rules and validation approach (so we ingest packs compliantly without rework).\\n\\n## Recommended next actions\\n- Wait for Agent 3’s scaling/window contract before creating any fixed-size UI sprite sheets beyond small icons.\\n- In parallel: shortlist 1–2 CC0/open-license packs per category (UI, heroes, enemies, buildings) and record pros/cons for cohesion.\\n- Once attribution conventions are locked: ingest pack subsets into existing override folders and add required attribution files.\\n",

No assets committed in this step; this is the integration plan for Tooling/QA/Ops to execute safely with attribution and minimal bloat.\\n\\n## Primary pack family (LOCKED)\\n**Primary**: **Kenney (CC0 / open-license on asset pages; verify per-pack before ingest)**\\n- Rationale: single-source cohesion across categories; clear silhouettes; consistent outline/value ramps; easy to curate subsets; scales cleanly to 32×32 with nearest-neighbor.\\n\\n**Minimal fallback (ONLY if primary lacks a required sprite/animation cleanly)**\\n- **LPC (Liberated Pixel Cup) characters** for hero animations only (walk/attack/hurt coverage).\\n  - Note: license is open but often attribution-required; only use if we decide to commit to LPC look for heroes or can normalize palette/outlines.\\n\\n## Mapping table (current entity types → planned sprites)\\n### Heroes (`assets/sprites/heroes/<class>/<action>/frame_###.png`)\\nInitial Build B rule: 1-frame placeholders are acceptable per action; we will duplicate a single canonical sprite into each action folder as `frame_000.png` until we add true multi-frame animation.\\n- `warrior` → Kenney: **Knight/Warrior** sprite (action folders: idle/walk/attack/hurt/inside use same frame_000 initially)\\n- `ranger` → Kenney: **Archer/Ranger** sprite\\n- `rogue` → Kenney: **Thief/Rogue** sprite\\n- `wizard` → Kenney: **Mage/Wizard** sprite\\n\\n### Enemies (`assets/sprites/enemies/<type>/<action>/frame_###.png`)\\n- `goblin` → Kenney: **Goblin/green humanoid monster**\\n- `wolf` → Kenney: **Wolf**\\n- `skeleton` → Kenney: **Skeleton**\\nActions to satisfy: `idle`, `walk`, `attack`, `hurt`, `dead` (duplicate 1 frame per action initially if needed).\\n\\n### Buildings (`assets/sprites/buildings/<building_type>/<state>/frame_###.png`)\\nInitial Build B rule: satisfy `built`, `construction`, `damaged` with at least one PNG each. If we lack distinct art for construction/damaged, duplicate the built frame into those state folders as `frame_000.png` (placeholder) so the validator can pass while we iterate.\\n\\nBuilding types (from `config.py`) and planned Kenney mappings (closest match wins):\\n- `castle` (3x3) → **Castle/Keep**\\n- `palace` (3x3) → **Castle/Keep (variant)** (or reuse castle until variant exists)\\n- `warrior_guild` (2x2) → **Barracks / Guild hall**\\n- `ranger_guild` (2x2) → **Hut/house (archer variant)**\\n- `rogue_guild` (2x2) → **Hut/house (thief variant)**\\n- `wizard_guild` (2x2) → **Mage hut / small tower**\\n- `marketplace` (2x2) → **Market stall / shop**\\n- `blacksmith` (2x2) → **Smithy / workshop**\\n- `inn` (2x2) → **Tavern / inn**\\n- `trading_post` (2x2) → **Shop / trader stall**\\n- `temple_agrela`..`temple_lunord` (3x3) → **Temple/chapel** (initially one shared temple sprite; later variants via palette/roof swaps)\\n- `gnome_hovel` (2x2) → **Cottage (small)**\\n- `elven_bungalow` (2x2) → **Cottage (green/wood)**\\n- `dwarven_settlement` (2x2) → **Stone house / workshop**\\n- `guardhouse` (2x2) → **Guard post / barracks**\\n- `ballista_tower` (1x1) → **Ballista / small tower**\\n- `wizard_tower` (2x2) → **Wizard tower**\\n- `fairgrounds` (3x3) → **Tents / fair area** (placeholder: large tent)\\n- `library` (2x2) → **Library / hall** (placeholder: civic building)\\n- `royal_gardens` (2x2) → **Garden/hedges** (placeholder: decorative greenery tile cluster)\\n- `house` (1x1) → **House**\\n- `farm` (2x2) → **Farm plot/barn**\\n- `food_stand` (1x1) → **Food stall**\\n\\n## Cohesion rules (must follow during ingest)\\n- **Nearest-neighbor only**: no smoothing/filtered scaling.\\n- **32×32 alignment**: if source art is 16×16, scale to 32×32 with nearest-neighbor; keep anchors consistent (feet/ground contact).\\n- **Outline thickness**: standardize to ~1px near-black outline for units/buildings; do not mix outline-free sprites with outlined sprites unless normalized.\\n- **Perspective**: prefer top-down-ish/diagonal consistent with current camera; avoid side-view sprites.\\n- **Value ramps**: favor 3-step ramps; keep world readable under fog-of-war.\\n- **Curate subsets**: do not import entire packs; only ship what maps to the above entity IDs and states.\\n\\n## Commands run (PASS evidence)\\n- PASS: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick`\\n  - Evidence snippet: `[qa_smoke] DONE: PASS`\\n\\n## Blockers\\nNone.
