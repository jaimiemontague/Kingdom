(I can create assets regardless; integration validation depends on the finalized contract.)\\n\\n## Recommended next actions\\n- Wait for Agent 3 contracts regarding inside-building + any animation-state signals before suggesting any engine-side state mapping tweaks.\\n- Begin producing the 4-class sprite set in the specified folder structure (Build B).\\n- Coordinate with Tools/QA only via their published harness: adopt their deterministic scenario for quick visual verification once it exists.\\n",

Round 1 deliverable is **art direction + asset conventions** (not a big implementation dump): define a cohesive UI skin direction (Majesty-like) and a safe plan for ingesting CC0/open-license pixel art with clean attribution while keeping `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` green.\\n\\n## Deliverables (Round 1 outputs)\\n- UI art direction constraints (palette/value, outlines, 9-slice style, icon readability) suitable for 1080p UI.\\n- Asset conventions for sprite ingestion (heroes/enemies/buildings) and UI icon/sheet usage without breaking pixel integrity.\\n- Acceptance criteria + test gates for Build A (UI + borderless) and Build B (asset ingestion).\\n\\n## Proposed changes (file boundaries; Round 1 = plan/spec only)\\n- Docs (safe, low-conflict):\\n  - Extend `docs/art/pixel_style_guide.md` with a short UI-skin section (panel materials, value ramps, outline rules).\\n  - Add `docs/art/ui_skin_style_guide.md` describing: 1080p UI scale targets, 9-slice padding rules, button states, and icon sizes (16/20/24 px).\\n- Assets (Build B, larger change):\\n  - Populate existing sprite override directories:\\n    - `assets/sprites/heroes/<class>/<action>/*.png`\\n    - `assets/sprites/enemies/<type>/<action>/*.png`\\n    - `assets/sprites/buildings/<type>/<state>/*.png`\\n  - UI sprites (optional; Build B): `assets/sprites/ui/` for icon PNGs if we move beyond procedural icons.\\n  - Attribution structure (expected, but owned by Tools/Ops): `assets/ATTRIBUTION.md` + `assets/third_party/<pack_name>/...`\\n\\n## Art direction (UI + sprites)\\n### 1) UI skin (Majesty-inspired, modern readable)\\n- **Value-first readability**: panels should be darker than world; text/icons high-value with 1px outline or shadow.\\n- **Materials**: carved wood + parchment + metal trims; avoid pure black/white.\\n- **9-slice panels**: corners must remain crisp; avoid gradients that band at 1080p.\\n- **Iconography**: prefer silhouette icons over text for bottom command bar; keep icon sizes consistent (recommended 20px) with a 1px outline and a dark plate for world-overlays.\\n- **State language**: hover/pressed/disabled should be readable with 2–3 value steps, not just hue shift.\\n\\n### 2) Sprite ingestion coherence\\n- Keep sprites **32x32 aligned** (or deterministically scaled to that); no smoothing/filtered scaling.\\n- Maintain class color accents consistent with existing placeholder language (Warrior=blue, Ranger=green, Rogue=desat steel/gray, Wizard=purple).\\n- Prefer packs with consistent outline thickness and ramp style; if mixed packs are unavoidable, normalize via palette/value adjustments.\\n\\n## Acceptance criteria + gates\\n### Build A (Midweek): borderless 1920x1080 + UI skeleton (no new art dependency)\\n- Default launch is **borderless 1920×1080**, or **borderless at native display resolution** if smaller.\\n- UI layout is readable at 1080p (no overlaps; text not clipped; minimap/panels fit).\\n- `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` remains PASS.\\n- Manual smoke (10 min) in both:\\n  - `python main.py --no-llm`\\n  - `python main.py --provider mock`\\n\\n### Build B (Endweek): pixel art for everything visible + attribution\\n- Heroes/enemies/buildings use pixel sprites when assets exist; procedural fallback OK for missing frames.\\n- Attribution is complete and clean (human-readable + verbatim license text preserved).\\n- No regressions: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` PASS.\\n\\n## Exact test commands (what I will treat as gates)\\n- Required: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick`\\n- Required manual: `python main.py --no-llm` and `python main.py --provider mock`\\n- Asset presence validation: to be added by Tools/QA (Agent 12/11) as a script; I will not guess the final command name.\\n\\n## Risks\\n- Mixed-pack art style drift (different outlines/palettes) makes the game feel inconsistent; mitigate by choosing one primary pack per category or normalizing ramps.\\n- UI scaling conflicts: if borderless+scaling strategy changes later, UI art sizing could thrash; mitigate by waiting for Agent 3’s locked scaling contract before producing UI sheet pixel sizes beyond icons.\\n- Repo size bloat: large CC0 packs can balloon repo; mitigate by selecting minimal subsets and documenting source packs in `assets/third_party/`.\\n\\n## Dependencies (blockers only)\\n- Agent 3 contract decision: final window scaling / UI scale strategy (so UI art can be authored at the correct pixel scale).\\n- Agent 12 + Agent 13 conventions: final attribution folder/file rules and validation approach (so we ingest packs compliantly without rework).\\n\\n## Recommended next actions\\n- Wait for Agent 3’s scaling/window contract before creating any fixed-size UI sprite sheets beyond small icons.\\n- In parallel: shortlist 1–2 CC0/open-license packs per category (UI, heroes, enemies, buildings) and record pros/cons for cohesion.\\n- Once attribution conventions are locked: ingest pack subsets into existing override folders and add required attribution files.\\n",

No assets committed in this step; this is the integration plan for Tooling/QA/Ops to execute safely with attribution and minimal bloat.\\n\\n## Primary pack family (LOCKED)\\n**Primary**: **Kenney (CC0 / open-license on asset pages; verify per-pack before ingest)**\\n- Rationale: single-source cohesion across categories; clear silhouettes; consistent outline/value ramps; easy to curate subsets; scales cleanly to 32×32 with nearest-neighbor.\\n\\n**Minimal fallback (ONLY if primary lacks a required sprite/animation cleanly)**\\n- **LPC (Liberated Pixel Cup) characters** for hero animations only (walk/attack/hurt coverage).\\n  - Note: license is open but often attribution-required; only use if we decide to commit to LPC look for heroes or can normalize palette/outlines.\\n\\n## Mapping table (current entity types → planned sprites)\\n### Heroes (`assets/sprites/heroes/<class>/<action>/frame_###.png`)\\nInitial Build B rule: 1-frame placeholders are acceptable per action; we will duplicate a single canonical sprite into each action folder as `frame_000.png` until we add true multi-frame animation.\\n- `warrior` → Kenney: **Knight/Warrior** sprite (action folders: idle/walk/attack/hurt/inside use same frame_000 initially)\\n- `ranger` → Kenney: **Archer/Ranger** sprite\\n- `rogue` → Kenney: **Thief/Rogue** sprite\\n- `wizard` → Kenney: **Mage/Wizard** sprite\\n\\n### Enemies (`assets/sprites/enemies/<type>/<action>/frame_###.png`)\\n- `goblin` → Kenney: **Goblin/green humanoid monster**\\n- `wolf` → Kenney: **Wolf**\\n- `skeleton` → Kenney: **Skeleton**\\nActions to satisfy: `idle`, `walk`, `attack`, `hurt`, `dead` (duplicate 1 frame per action initially if needed).\\n\\n### Buildings (`assets/sprites/buildings/<building_type>/<state>/frame_###.png`)\\nInitial Build B rule: satisfy `built`, `construction`, `damaged` with at least one PNG each. If we lack distinct art for construction/damaged, duplicate the built frame into those state folders as `frame_000.png` (placeholder) so the validator can pass while we iterate.\\n\\nBuilding types (from `config.py`) and planned Kenney mappings (closest match wins):\\n- `castle` (3x3) → **Castle/Keep**\\n- `palace` (3x3) → **Castle/Keep (variant)** (or reuse castle until variant exists)\\n- `warrior_guild` (2x2) → **Barracks / Guild hall**\\n- `ranger_guild` (2x2) → **Hut/house (archer variant)**\\n- `rogue_guild` (2x2) → **Hut/house (thief variant)**\\n- `wizard_guild` (2x2) → **Mage hut / small tower**\\n- `marketplace` (2x2) → **Market stall / shop**\\n- `blacksmith` (2x2) → **Smithy / workshop**\\n- `inn` (2x2) → **Tavern / inn**\\n- `trading_post` (2x2) → **Shop / trader stall**\\n- `temple_agrela`..`temple_lunord` (3x3) → **Temple/chapel** (initially one shared temple sprite; later variants via palette/roof swaps)\\n- `gnome_hovel` (2x2) → **Cottage (small)**\\n- `elven_bungalow` (2x2) → **Cottage (green/wood)**\\n- `dwarven_settlement` (2x2) → **Stone house / workshop**\\n- `guardhouse` (2x2) → **Guard post / barracks**\\n- `ballista_tower` (1x1) → **Ballista / small tower**\\n- `wizard_tower` (2x2) → **Wizard tower**\\n- `fairgrounds` (3x3) → **Tents / fair area** (placeholder: large tent)\\n- `library` (2x2) → **Library / hall** (placeholder: civic building)\\n- `royal_gardens` (2x2) → **Garden/hedges** (placeholder: decorative greenery tile cluster)\\n- `house` (1x1) → **House**\\n- `farm` (2x2) → **Farm plot/barn**\\n- `food_stand` (1x1) → **Food stall**\\n\\n## Cohesion rules (must follow during ingest)\\n- **Nearest-neighbor only**: no smoothing/filtered scaling.\\n- **32×32 alignment**: if source art is 16×16, scale to 32×32 with nearest-neighbor; keep anchors consistent (feet/ground contact).\\n- **Outline thickness**: standardize to ~1px near-black outline for units/buildings; do not mix outline-free sprites with outlined sprites unless normalized.\\n- **Perspective**: prefer top-down-ish/diagonal consistent with current camera; avoid side-view sprites.\\n- **Value ramps**: favor 3-step ramps; keep world readable under fog-of-war.\\n- **Curate subsets**: do not import entire packs; only ship what maps to the above entity IDs and states.\\n\\n## Commands run (PASS evidence)\\n- PASS: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick`\\n  - Evidence snippet: `[qa_smoke] DONE: PASS`\\n\\n## Blockers\\nNone.

keep tiny.\\n\\n### Minimum state cues\\n- `idle`: bow down/relaxed; subtle bob; feet planted.\\n- `walk`: bow held tighter; one leg forward; maintain silhouette.\\n- `attack`: unique frame with bow drawn and a tiny highlight/spark at bow tip; body lean forward.\\n- `hurt`: one-frame recoil; bow droops; head tilt.\\n- `dead`: collapsed bones + bow separated (bow can be 2–4px off to the side) so it reads as an archer corpse.\\n\\n### Color/material notes (aligned with WK3 target)\\n- Bones: off-white ramp (no pure white) with cool shadow.\\n- Bow: warm brown ramp; keep outline near-black.\\n- Cloth accent: muted red/purple sash (1–3px) to differentiate from melee skeleton without adding noise.\\n\\n## Acceptance criteria to lock (art/pipeline relevant)\\n- Enemy is visually distinguishable at **Z2** from melee skeleton in `enemy_catalog` closeups (bow silhouette reads).\\n- Asset folders exist with at least one PNG:\\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/idle/frame_000.png`\\n  - `.../walk/frame_000.png`\\n  - `.../attack/frame_000.png`\\n  - `.../hurt/frame_000.png`\\n  - `.../dead/frame_000.png`\\n- Visual Snapshot System: `enemy_catalog` produces a closeup PNG for `skeleton_archer` and gallery builds successfully.\\n- Strict validator passes: `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution` (note: if placeholders are first-party/procedural, attribution should not require adding a third-party pack).\\n\\n## Risks + mitigations\\n- **Readability risk**: archer reads too similar to skeleton melee at Z2.\\n  - Mitigation: enforce bow C-curve silhouette + quiver strap + distinct attack pose.\\n- **Noise risk**: over-detailing bones/gear creates shimmer at small size.\\n  - Mitigation: keep to the WK3 noise budget (units low texture; 3-step ramps).\\n- **Pipeline mismatch risk**: plan says “existing generator” but generator naming/path may differ.\\n  - Mitigation: Agent 12 confirms the exact placeholder generator tool (likely `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py`) and ensures it can emit the new enemy frames.\\n\\n## Concrete file touchpoints expected (paths only; no implementation yet)\\n- `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/{idle,walk,attack,hurt,dead}/frame_000.png`\\n- `tools/assets_manifest.json` (add `skeleton_archer` under enemies)\\n- `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` (emit the new frames)\\n- `game/graphics/enemy_sprites.py` (procedural fallback recognition, if needed)\\n- `tools/screenshot_scenarios.py` / `tools/capture_screenshots.py` (enemy_catalog should pick up via manifest)\\n\\n## Questions (blockers only; max 3)\\n1) Can Agent 12 confirm the canonical placeholder generator script name/path we should extend for `skeleton_archer` (plan references an \"existing generator\")?\\n\\n## Next actions\\n- Post this art contract into my agent log (done) so Agents 03/05/11/12 can lock behavior/tunables/tests against a stable sprite expectation.\\n- If PM greenlights Build A implementation, coordinate with Agent 12 to ensure the generator outputs a clear bow/quiver silhouette within the WK3 style contract.\\n",

I understand my role is **art signoff only** for placeholder sprites: verify `skeleton_archer` reads as ranged at 32×32/Z2 via `enemy_catalog` snapshots after implementation lands.\n\n## Context refresh summary\n- **WK3 status**: Closed and shipped (Prototype v1.2.4).\n- **WK4 feature**: New enemy type `skeleton_archer` (ranged kiter), spawned from Skeleton Crypt.\n- **My wk4_r1 deliverable**: Art/readability contract defining bow C-curve silhouette, quiver strap, distinct attack pose, and minimum per-state cues (idle/walk/attack/hurt/dead) at 32×32 consistent with `docs/art/wk3_major_graphics_target.md`.\n\n## Locked Build A decisions (ACK'd)\n- **Ranged-only** in Build A (no melee fallback) — art contract supports this with distinct bow silhouette.\n- **Instant-hit ranged** (no projectile system) — art contract allows sprite-only attack pose with optional tiny spark at bow tip.\n- **Kiting behavior** with distance band — no art impact; behavior-only.\n- **Deterministic 80/20 spawn mix** (skeleton / skeleton_archer) from Skeleton Crypt — no art impact.\n- **Pipeline completeness mandatory**:\n  - Add `skeleton_archer` to `tools/assets_manifest.json`\n  - Generate placeholder PNGs: `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/{idle,walk,attack,hurt,dead}/frame_000.png`\n  - Gates: `qa_smoke --quick`, `validate_assets --strict --check-attribution`, `enemy_catalog` snapshot + gallery build\n\n## Role-specific deliverables (Agent 09)\n- **Art signoff criteria** (from wk4_r1, still valid):\n  - Bow C-curve silhouette obvious at Z2\n  - Quiver/strap cue present (or second clear ranged cue)\n  - Attack pose clearly draw/release (even if instant-hit)\n  - Dead pose includes bow separation for readability\n  - Style compliance: 1px outline, top-left light, subtle baked shadow, low noise\n- **Post-implementation verification** (after Agent 12/Integrator lands changes):\n  - Run `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` (must PASS)\n  - Run `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution` (must PASS)\n  - Run `python tools/capture_screenshots.py --scenario enemy_catalog --seed 3 --out docs/screenshots/wk4_after/enemy_catalog_seed3 --size 1920x1080 --ticks 0` (must produce skeleton_archer closeup PNG)\n  - Run `python tools/build_gallery.py --shots docs/screenshots/wk4_after --refs .cursor/plans/art_examples --out docs/art/compare_gallery.html` (must build browsable gallery)\n  - Visual review: skeleton_archer is clearly ranged and distinct from melee skeleton in enemy_catalog closeup at Z2\n\n## Blockers (none)\n- No blockers preventing Build A implementation.\n- Art contract from wk4_r1 is stable and ready for implementation.\n- Placeholder generator path confirmed: `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` (Agent 12 owns this).\n\n## Expected file touchpoints (paths only; no code yet)\n- **Placeholder sprites** (generated by Agent 12):\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/idle/frame_000.png`\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/walk/frame_000.png`\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/attack/frame_000.png`\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/hurt/frame_000.png`\n  - `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/dead/frame_000.png`\n- **Manifest** (Agent 12):\n  - `tools/assets_manifest.json` (add `skeleton_archer` under enemies)\n- **Generator** (Agent 12):\n  - `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` (emit skeleton_archer frames)\n- **Graphics fallback** (if needed, Agent 12 or implementer):\n  - `game/graphics/enemy_sprites.py` (procedural fallback recognition)\n- **Snapshot system** (Agent 12, already manifest-driven):\n  - `tools/screenshot_scenarios.py` / `tools/capture_screenshots.py` (enemy_catalog auto-includes via manifest)\n- **Agent 09 log** (this file):\n  - `.cursor/plans/agent_logs/agent_09_ArtDirector_Pixel_Animation_VFX.json` (signoff evidence)\n\n## Risks + mitigations (art/pipeline only)\n- **Readability risk**: skeleton_archer reads too similar to melee skeleton at Z2.\n  - **Mitigation**: Enforce strong bow C-curve silhouette + quiver strap + distinct attack pose (already in art contract). If snapshots show confusion, request smallest sprite-only tweak (stronger bow/quiver/pose) as Build A clarity safeguard.\n- **Noise risk**: Over-texturing causes shimmer/noise at 32×32.\n  - **Mitigation**: Keep to WK3 noise budget (3-step ramps, low unit texture, minimal interior linework). Placeholder generator must respect this.\n- **Pipeline mismatch risk**: Placeholder generator may not emit bow/quiver silhouette clearly.\n  - **Mitigation**: Coordinate with Agent 12 to ensure generator outputs clear bow C-curve and quiver strap within WK3 style contract. If generator cannot produce readable silhouette, request manual sprite adjustment (still procedural/first-party, no attribution needed).\n\n## Questions (blockers only; max 3)\nNone. Art contract is stable and ready for implementation.\n\n## Next actions\n- Wait for Agent 12/Integrator to land manifest + placeholder PNG generation + snapshot run.\n- After implementation, run the 4 required commands and post PASS/FAIL evidence + screenshot filename(s) checked.\n- If readability fails at Z2, report concrete art blocker (what cue is missing and which sprite/action frame to adjust) without proposing new systems.\n",
