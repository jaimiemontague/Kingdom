Add/confirm overlay rules:\\n- Plate behind icons/text\\n- 1px outline on light shapes\\n- Prefer shapes over text\\n- Prioritize value contrast over hue\\n\\nDoc update: `docs/art/pixel_style_guide.md`\\n\\n### 3) Reserved folder for future hand-drawn UI icons (optional)\\n- `assets/sprites/ui/README.md` (+ `.gitkeep`)\\n\\n## Recommended icon language (what UI should display)\\n- Bounty type: one symbol near marker (compass / swords / shield / reticle)\\n- Attractiveness tier: 1/2/3 chevrons (low/med/high)\\n- Prefer composite badge: `get_bounty_badge()`\\n\\n## Acceptance criteria\\n- Bounty marker can display type + tier (or composite badge) readable over fog/terrain\\n- No external PNG assets required for Build A\\n- Icons cached (no per-frame allocations)\\n\\n## Risks\\n- If UI draws icons without plate/outline, they’ll get lost under fog/noisy tiles\\n- If icons are scaled with smoothing, they’ll blur; use nearest-neighbor\\n- Always-visible badges could add clutter if bounty counts get high\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n- Agent 8 decision: always-visible vs hover/selection, and exact placement\\n- Agent 3/5/6: define/compute attractiveness tier strings (low/med/high)\\n\\n## Questions back to PM\\n1) Tier color language: blue/gold/orange (cool→warm) vs green/yellow/red?\\n2) Visibility policy: always-visible vs hover/selection?\\n3) Future-proofing: icons emphasize action (sword/shield/compass) or target?\\n\\n## Recommended next actions\\n- Agent 8: integrate `get_bounty_badge()` into bounty overlay/tooltip\\n- Wire attractiveness tier strings once available\\n- Optionally replace procedural icons with PNGs later without changing UI contract",
