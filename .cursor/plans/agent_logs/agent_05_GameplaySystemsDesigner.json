I’m assuming the sprint plan’s `sprint_id`/`round_id` are the source of truth and the timestamps are just when logs were written.\\n\\n### Deliverables\\n- Initial tunables for `skeleton_archer` (v0) + rationale.\\n- Initial `SkeletonCrypt` spawn mix recommendation (v0) + difficulty-risk notes.\\n- Acceptance criteria for gameplay feel (kite behavior) and “no-scope-creep” Build A baseline (instant-hit ranged).\\n\\n### Proposed scope split (WK4)\\n- **Build A (midweek)**: instant-hit ranged damage + simple kiting behavior (maintain distance band), spawns from SkeletonCrypt, CC0 procedural placeholder art, validator + snapshot coverage, deterministic-safe logic.\\n- **Build B (endweek)**: tuning pass + readability polish (sound/flash cue), optional *simple* projectile/VFX line only if needed for clarity (no physics); perf sanity + additional QA assertions.\\n\\n### Proposed initial tunables (v0)\\nGoal: “annoying pressure” unit that punishes overextending heroes and forces fights to stretch out, but is still killable and not an infinite kite.\\n- **HP**: 40\\n- **Attack (ranged)**: 4\\n- **Speed**: 1.35\\n- **Attack range (tiles)**: 6.0\\n- **Min range (tiles)**: 2.0 (will attempt to kite if hero is closer)\\n- **Attack cooldown (ms)**: 1400\\n- **Gold reward**: same as Skeleton baseline initially (avoid economy spike); can tune later.\\n\\nWhy these numbers: slightly sturdier than goblin but lower DPS than a melee skeleton; longer engagement time; kiting creates indirect pressure without burst-killing peasants instantly.\\n\\n### Spawn mix (SkeletonCrypt)\\n- Start with **80/20** split: `skeleton` / `skeleton_archer`.\\n- If threat feels too low, move to **70/30** in Build B.\\n\\nRationale: crypt already signals “tougher”; archers should be present often enough to be learned, but not so frequent that early parties stall forever.\\n\\n### Acceptance criteria (lock these for implementation)\\n- **Behavior**: `skeleton_archer` attempts to maintain a distance band (min range respected) and attacks from range; it should not stand still and trade in melee unless cornered.\\n- **No infinite kiting**: if kiting fails N times (blocked) it should fall back to a simpler behavior (keep attacking or reposition slightly) to avoid CPU churn.\\n- **No projectile system required for Build A**: instant-hit ranged damage is acceptable as long as there is a readable cue (animation/VFX/audio).\\n- **Determinism**: decisions based on sim-time + seeded RNG only; no wall-clock; stable target selection order.\\n- **Gates**: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` and `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution` pass; Visual Snapshot System `enemy_catalog` includes the new enemy and gallery builds.\\n\\n### Risks + mitigations\\n- **Balance risk: ‘softlock by kiting’** (heroes chase forever, never kill): mitigate with min-range band + bounded repath attempts + occasional “stand-and-shoot” fallback when stuck.\\n- **Balance risk: peasant wipe** (ranged picks off workers): mitigate by using same targeting priorities as other enemies (likely heroes first) and keeping per-hit damage low.\\n- **UX risk: instant-hit feels unfair**: mitigate with clear wind-up animation + small muzzle-flash/beam/arrow-swish VFX (non-projectile) and combat log/HUD message if needed.\\n- **Perf risk: per-frame pathing for kiting**: mitigate with cooldowned repositioning (only re-evaluate every ~0.5–1.0s sim-time) + reuse existing navigation patterns.\\n- **Determinism risk: tie-break drift**: mitigate with stable sorting (entity id/order) and deterministic RNG stream usage.\\n\\n### Concrete file touchpoints (paths only; no implementation yet)\\n- `config.py` (add `SKELETON_ARCHER_*` tunables)\\n- `game/entities/enemy.py` (add enemy class + ranged/kite logic)\\n- `game/entities/lair.py` (SkeletonCrypt spawn mix)\\n- `tools/assets_manifest.json` (add enemy type)\\n- `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` (procedural placeholder frames entry)\\n- `game/graphics/enemy_sprites.py` (ensure fallback recognizes new type)\\n- `tools/screenshot_scenarios.py` (verify enemy_catalog reads manifest; should auto-include)\\n\\n### Questions (blockers only)\\n- None.\\n\\n### Next actions\\n- Wait for PM (wk4_r2) to lock the tunables + spawn mix.\\n- If PM requests tighter numbers, I’ll provide a 2nd pass tuned around observed TTK and chase behavior once a headless repro scenario exists.",

Implemented skeleton_archer enemy class with ranged kiting behavior, added config tunables, and updated SkeletonCrypt spawn mix to 80/20. All determinism/perf guardrails respected (sim-time only, seeded RNG, stable ordering, rate-limited reposition).\\n\\n### Deliverables\\n- **config.py**: Added SKELETON_ARCHER_* tunables (HP=40, ATK=4, speed=1.35, range=6.0 tiles, min_range=2.0 tiles, cooldown=1400ms).\\n- **game/entities/enemy.py**: Implemented SkeletonArcher class with:\\n  - Ranged-only instant-hit attack (no projectile system)\\n  - Kiting behavior: maintains distance band (min_range to attack_range)\\n  - Hysteresis/commitment: 500ms commitment window to avoid jitter\\n  - Cooldowned repositioning: re-evaluates every 800ms (sim-time)\\n  - Bounded attempts: max 5 kite attempts per target, then fallback to stand-and-shoot\\n  - Deterministic: uses now_ms() for all timing, stable target key tracking\\n- **game/entities/lair.py**: Updated SkeletonCrypt.spawn_enemies to use deterministic 80/20 mix (skeleton/skeleton_archer) via lair RNG.\\n\\n### Files changed\\n- `config.py`: Added SKELETON_ARCHER_HP, SKELETON_ARCHER_ATTACK, SKELETON_ARCHER_SPEED, SKELETON_ARCHER_ATTACK_RANGE_TILES, SKELETON_ARCHER_MIN_RANGE_TILES, SKELETON_ARCHER_ATTACK_COOLDOWN_MS\\n- `game/entities/enemy.py`: Added SkeletonArcher class (396-556 lines) with kiting update() override; updated imports to include new config constants\\n- `game/entities/lair.py`: Updated SkeletonCrypt.spawn_enemies() to use 80/20 mix; added SkeletonArcher to imports\\n\\n### How to test\\n- **Gate 1**: `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` → PASS (exit_code=0)\\n- **Gate 2**: `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution` → Pending Agent 12 (manifest + placeholders)\\n- **Gate 3**: `python tools/capture_screenshots.py --scenario enemy_catalog --seed 3 --out docs/screenshots/wk4_after/enemy_catalog_seed3 --size 1920x1080 --ticks 0` → Pending Agent 12 (manifest update)\\n- **Gate 4**: `python tools/build_gallery.py --shots docs/screenshots/wk4_after --refs .cursor/plans/art_examples --out docs/art/compare_gallery.html` → Pending Agent 12\\n- **Manual smoke**: Run `python main.py --no-llm` and observe SkeletonCrypt spawns include skeleton_archer (80/20 mix); verify archer attacks from range and attempts to maintain distance (no jitter oscillation).\\n\\n### Evidence (commands + outputs)\\n- **qa_smoke --quick**: PASS\\n  - determinism_guard: PASS (no violations)\\n  - All scenarios: PASS (default, intent_bounty, hero_stuck_repro, no-enemies, mock-LLM)\\n  - Exit code: 0\\n  - Full output: see terminal output above (determinism_guard PASS, all observe_sync scenarios PASS)\\n\\n### Risks + mitigations (implemented)\\n- **Softlock-by-kite**: Mitigated with bounded attempts (max 5) + fallback to stand-and-shoot when attempts exceeded.\\n- **Jitter oscillation**: Mitigated with hysteresis/commitment window (500ms) + cooldowned repositioning (800ms interval).\\n- **Perf risk**: Mitigated with rate-limited reposition evaluations (only every ~0.8s sim-time) + reuse existing navigation patterns.\\n- **Determinism risk**: Mitigated with sim-time only (now_ms()), stable target key tracking (id/position tuple), deterministic lair RNG for spawn mix.\\n\\n### Dependencies (blockers resolved)\\n- **Agent 12**: Must add skeleton_archer to tools/assets_manifest.json and generate placeholder PNGs before validate_assets + snapshot gates can pass. This is expected and non-blocking for gameplay code implementation.\\n- **Agent 09**: Visual signoff on placeholder silhouette (bow/quiver cues) — expected after Agent 12 generates placeholders.\\n\\n### Ready-for-integration criteria (met)\\n- Config tunables match v0 values (HP40/ATK4/speed1.35/range6/min2/cd1400ms).\\n- Spawn mix is exactly 80/20 from SkeletonCrypt, deterministic via lair RNG.\\n- No new systems introduced (no projectile sim); only minimal deterministic readability cues (attack pose via animation system).\\n- Determinism guardrails respected: sim-time only, seeded RNG streams, stable ordering.\\n- qa_smoke --quick PASS.\\n\\n### Follow-ups (Build B only)\\n- If unit is too lethal: reduce attack to 3, increase cooldown to 1600-1800ms, or reduce spawn mix to 90/10.\\n- If too softlocky: reduce speed to 1.2, reduce max range to 5.0, or strengthen stand-and-shoot fallback.\\n- If too weak: increase spawn mix to 70/30 or slightly increase range to 6.5 while keeping DPS flat.",
