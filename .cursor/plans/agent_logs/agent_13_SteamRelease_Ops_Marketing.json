My focus is release hygiene: keep attribution/asset validation and the Visual Snapshot System updated so the new enemy can ship without breaking gates, and so patch notes/credits stay accurate.\\n\\nNote on process: the WK4 plan lists Agent 13 as consult-only for wk4_r1, but the universal prompt explicitly requests all agents to log wk4_r1. I’m complying with the prompt, and keeping this strictly plan/spec (no code).\\n\\n### Deliverables\\n- Define the release-facing acceptance criteria for this feature slice (what we can claim in patch notes, what must be validated first).\\n- Define attribution/asset validation expectations for the new enemy’s placeholder sprite folders (CC0 placeholder set) so `validate_assets --strict --check-attribution` remains green.\\n- Define Visual Snapshot System expectations: `enemy_catalog` must include `skeleton_archer` and gallery remains buildable.\\n\\n### Proposed scope split (Build A vs Build B)\\n- **Build A (midweek)**: ship `skeleton_archer` end-to-end (spawn + behavior + CC0 placeholder sprites + validator + enemy_catalog snapshot coverage). Ranged damage can be **instant-hit** (no projectile system) to keep risk low.\\n- **Build B (endweek)**: optional polish only if stable: tuning, readability cues (VFX/sound), optional simple projectile/VFX line *only if it stays deterministic and low-risk*.\\n\\n### Acceptance criteria (release-facing; must be lockable)\\n- Gates:\\n  - `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` => PASS\\n  - `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution` => PASS\\n- Attribution/compliance:\\n  - If any new third-party pack directory is added under `assets/third_party/`, `assets/ATTRIBUTION.md` must include that pack (author/license/source/retrieved/modifications/used-for/file locations).\\n  - If the new enemy uses only the existing in-repo CC0 placeholder set, no new third-party pack is required, but the validator must still see required `frame_000.png` coverage for `skeleton_archer`.\\n- Visual Snapshot System:\\n  - `python tools/capture_screenshots.py --scenario enemy_catalog --seed 3 ...` includes a `skeleton_archer` shot (or equivalent manifest entry) and `python tools/build_gallery.py ...` remains buildable.\\n- Patch notes:\\n  - We only claim “new ranged enemy: Skeleton Archer (kiting)” once QA confirms spawn + behavior in `--no-llm` and `--provider mock` manual smoke (or equivalent deterministic scenario evidence).\\n\\n### Risks + mitigations (release hygiene)\\n- **Determinism risk**: kiting/retreat loops can thrash if tied to wall-clock or unstable ordering. Mitigation: insist on sim-time/ticks + stable tie-break rules; keep instant-hit first pass (no projectile sim).\\n- **Pipeline risk**: strict validator fails when new enemy is added to manifest but placeholder frames aren’t generated in all required action folders. Mitigation: update placeholder generator/manifest in the same PR as the new enemy type; keep required states aligned to validator manifest.\\n- **Readability risk**: ranged damage feels “unfair” without a cue. Mitigation: minimum VFX/sound cue in Build B if needed, but keep it deterministic and non-spammy.\\n- **Repo bloat risk**: avoid importing full packs for a single enemy in Build A; prefer procedural/in-repo placeholders.\\n\\n### Concrete file touchpoints (paths only; no implementation yet)\\n- `tools/assets_manifest.json` (add `skeleton_archer` under enemies.types)\\n- `tools/validate_assets.py` (only if manifest/state requirements need adjustment; avoid loosening strictness)\\n- `tools/capture_screenshots.py` / `tools/screenshot_scenarios.py` (ensure enemy_catalog scenario includes new type, ideally via manifest auto-read)\\n- `docs/sprint/wk4_*_patch_notes_draft.md` (or the sprint’s patch-notes doc once created)\\n- `assets/ATTRIBUTION.md` (only if introducing any new third-party pack)\\n- `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/{idle,walk,attack,hurt,dead}/frame_000.png` (expected output of CC0 placeholder generator)\\n\\n### Questions (blockers only)\\n1) Confirm the exact `enemy_type` string is **`skeleton_archer`** everywhere (spawn system + manifest + folder name).\\n2) Confirm whether Build A uses **only** the existing in-repo CC0 placeholder set (preferred) vs adding any new third-party pack this sprint.\\n3) Does the current Visual Snapshot System enemy catalog auto-read `tools/assets_manifest.json`? If not, which file is the single source of truth for the enemy list so we can avoid drift?\\n\\n### Next actions\\n- Wait for PM synthesis (wk4_r2) to lock tunables and determinism constraints; then I’ll draft Build A/Build B patch note skeletons with precise, gated claims and credits rules.\\n- Once Agent 12 confirms manifest + snapshot auto-inclusion, align the release checklist wording so the required commands remain: qa_smoke, validate_assets strict, and enemy_catalog snapshot regeneration.",

For WK4, assume we extend existing snapshot tooling (manifest-driven inclusion).\n\n### Locked Build A decisions (confirmed understanding)\n- **Ranged-only in Build A** (no melee fallback).\n- **Instant-hit ranged in Build A** (no projectile system).\n- **Kiting behavior**: maintain a distance band with hysteresis/commitment to avoid jitter.\n- **Deterministic spawn mix from Skeleton Crypt**: 80/20 skeleton / skeleton_archer (use lair RNG; deterministic).\n- **Pipeline completeness is mandatory**:\n  - Add skeleton_archer to `tools/assets_manifest.json` so strict validator + enemy_catalog snapshots include it.\n  - Generate placeholder PNGs: `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/{idle,walk,attack,hurt,dead}/frame_000.png`.\n- **Gates required (must stay PASS)**:\n  - `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick`\n  - `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution`\n  - Visual Snapshot System: enemy_catalog includes skeleton_archer and gallery builds.\n- **Allowed clarity safeguard (Build A)**: a tiny deterministic cue (attack pose + minimal impact flash) is allowed only if needed for readability, but no new systems.\n\n### Role-specific deliverables for WK4\n- **Patch notes drafts**: Create `docs/sprint/wk4_buildA_patch_notes_draft.md` (and Build B if applicable) with precise, gated claims:\n  - Only claim \"new ranged enemy: Skeleton Archer (kiting)\" after QA confirms spawn + behavior in `--no-llm` and `--provider mock` manual smoke.\n  - Include required test commands (qa_smoke, validate_assets strict, enemy_catalog snapshot regeneration).\n  - Include standard \"No API keys required\" section.\n- **Attribution compliance**: If any new third-party pack is introduced (unlikely for Build A if using in-repo CC0 placeholders), ensure `assets/ATTRIBUTION.md` and per-pack LICENSE/README files are complete.\n- **Release checklist alignment**: Ensure release-facing acceptance criteria match the locked gates and snapshot expectations.\n\n### Blockers (none)\n- No blockers from Agent 13 perspective.

I'm proceeding using the locked decisions stated in the context refresh prompt as the source of truth.\n\n### Expected file touchpoints (paths only; no code yet)\n- `docs/sprint/wk4_buildA_patch_notes_draft.md` (create when implementation is ready for release)\n- `docs/sprint/wk4_buildB_patch_notes_draft.md` (create if Build B scope is locked)\n- `assets/ATTRIBUTION.md` (only if a new third-party pack is introduced; unlikely for Build A if using in-repo CC0 placeholders)\n- No code changes from Agent 13 (docs-only deliverables).\n\n### Risks + mitigations (release hygiene)\n- **Pipeline risk**: If skeleton_archer is added to manifest but placeholder frames aren't generated, strict validator will fail. Mitigation: coordinate with Agent 12 to ensure manifest + placeholder generator updates land atomically.\n- **Claim accuracy risk**: Overstating behavior (e.g., \"kiting works perfectly\") before QA verification. Mitigation: keep patch notes gated by QA confirmation; use precise language (\"attempts to maintain distance\" vs \"maintains optimal range\").\n- **Snapshot drift risk**: If enemy_catalog scenario doesn't auto-read manifest, skeleton_archer may be missing from snapshots. Mitigation: verify with Agent 12 that snapshot scenarios are manifest-driven before claiming snapshot coverage in patch notes.\n\n### Next actions\n- Stand by for implementation greenlight (wk4_r3).\n- Once implementation lands and QA confirms behavior: draft Build A patch notes with verified bullets only.\n- Ensure patch notes include required test commands and snapshot/gallery regeneration steps.\n- If Build B scope is locked: prepare Build B patch notes draft with optional polish highlights (tuning, readability cues) only if stable.",
