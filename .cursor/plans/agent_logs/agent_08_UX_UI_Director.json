Deliver UI copy + layout rules for **hero intent/last decision** and **bounty responders/attractiveness**, kept readable and non-spammy, and safe in mock/no-LLM.\n\n### Deliverables\n- **Hero inspect UI (FS-1)**:\n  - Show **Current intent** (single, stable label).\n  - Show **Last decision** (action + short reason + age), with safe placeholder if none yet.\n  - Must work in **LLM + mock + no-LLM**.\n- **Bounty legibility UI (FS-2)**:\n  - Each bounty displays **Responders: N**.\n  - Each bounty displays **Attractiveness: Low/Med/High** (or compact icon/text).\n  - Deterministic computation; no extra LLM calls.\n- **Low-risk HUD clarity**:\n  - Reduce always-on “wall of controls” via **toggleable help**.\n  - Show a small **mode banner** when placing a building.\n\n### Proposed UI copy (player-facing)\n- **Hero panel**\n  - `Intent: <Idle | Moving | Engaging enemy | Pursuing bounty | Shopping | Returning to safety | Resting>`\n  - `Last decision: <action> → <target> (<age>s ago) — <short reason>`\n  - Placeholder: `Last decision: (none yet)`\n  - Notes:\n    - Keep reason to ~1 short clause, truncate with ellipsis if needed.\n    - “Age” should be based on **sim-time** (tick/sim clock), not wall-clock.\n\n- **Bounty marker**\n  - `R:<N>  <Low|Med|High>`\n  - Optional expanded tooltip later: `Responders: N` / `Attractiveness: <tier>`\n\n- **Placement mode banner**\n  - `Placing: <Building Name> (LMB: place, ESC: cancel)`\n\n- **Help toggle hint**\n  - When hidden: `F3: Help`\n  - Header: `Controls (F3 to hide)`\n\n### UI layout rules (readability)\n- **Prioritize “now” info**:\n  - Always-visible: gold / counts / wave + small mode banner when applicable.\n  - On-demand: the full control list (help overlay).\n- **Avoid spam**:\n  - Toast messages should be short and non-repeating.\n  - Prefer persistent labels for state (intent/banner) over repeated popups.\n- **Truncation/overflow**:\n  - Never overflow panels; truncate long reasoning lines.\n  - Keep bounty labels compact; avoid multi-line text in world space.\n- **Color semantics**\n  - Attractiveness tiers: Low=gray, Med=gold, High=green.\n  - Keep text readable over fog-of-war; use high contrast.\n\n### Acceptance criteria (for UX slice)\n- Selecting a hero shows **Intent** and **Last decision** (or safe placeholder).\n- Last decision shows **age** derived from sim-time (or blank if unavailable).\n- Each bounty shows **Responders** and **Attractiveness tier**.\n- No crashes if hero has no decision yet / no heroes exist / no bounties exist.\n- UI additions do not allocate heavily per frame (keep text generation lightweight).\n\n### Risks\n- **Mismatch between UI “intent” and future intent taxonomy**: mitigate by keeping labels stable and mapping from real fields when they exist.\n- **Perf regression** from per-frame string work: mitigate by keeping computations lightweight and capped; avoid per-frame allocations where possible.\n- **Visual clutter** if too much overlay text: keep bounty markers compact and help toggleable.\n\n### Dependencies / coordination notes\n- **Agent 3 (Architecture)**: eventual stable contract for `hero.intent` and `hero.last_decision` will replace UI-side inference.\n- **Agent 6 (AIBehaviorDirector_LLM)**: align naming for intent labels and ensure “reason” strings stay short.\n- **Agent 9 (Art/VFX)**: optional iconography for attractiveness tiers; must remain readable over fog-of-war.\n\n### Questions back to PM (max 3)\n- Should help overlay default to **ON** for Build A to support onboarding, or **OFF** to reduce clutter?\n- Should attractiveness reflect **global** risk/reward or be **class-aware** (align with AI scoring) in future?\n- Any preferred copy tone: more “Majesty-like” flavor or strictly utilitarian labels for now?\n\n### Recommended next actions\n- Hook future `hero.intent`/`hero.last_decision` contract into UI when available (remove inference).\n- Add hover tooltips for bounty markers (optional) and/or a tiny legend for Low/Med/High.\n- Add a “bounty placement mode” (toggle B, click to place, ESC cancel) if misfires become common.\n",
