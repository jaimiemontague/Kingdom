Deliver UI copy + layout rules for **hero intent/last decision** and **bounty responders/attractiveness**, kept readable and non-spammy, and safe in mock/no-LLM.\n\n### Deliverables\n- **Hero inspect UI (FS-1)**:\n  - Show **Current intent** (single, stable label).\n  - Show **Last decision** (action + short reason + age), with safe placeholder if none yet.\n  - Must work in **LLM + mock + no-LLM**.\n- **Bounty legibility UI (FS-2)**:\n  - Each bounty displays **Responders: N**.\n  - Each bounty displays **Attractiveness: Low/Med/High** (or compact icon/text).\n  - Deterministic computation; no extra LLM calls.\n- **Low-risk HUD clarity**:\n  - Reduce always-on “wall of controls” via **toggleable help**.\n  - Show a small **mode banner** when placing a building.\n\n### Proposed UI copy (player-facing)\n- **Hero panel**\n  - `Intent: <Idle | Moving | Engaging enemy | Pursuing bounty | Shopping | Returning to safety | Resting>`\n  - `Last decision: <action> → <target> (<age>s ago) — <short reason>`\n  - Placeholder: `Last decision: (none yet)`\n  - Notes:\n    - Keep reason to ~1 short clause, truncate with ellipsis if needed.\n    - “Age” should be based on **sim-time** (tick/sim clock), not wall-clock.\n\n- **Bounty marker**\n  - `R:<N>  <Low|Med|High>`\n  - Optional expanded tooltip later: `Responders: N` / `Attractiveness: <tier>`\n\n- **Placement mode banner**\n  - `Placing: <Building Name> (LMB: place, ESC: cancel)`\n\n- **Help toggle hint**\n  - When hidden: `F3: Help`\n  - Header: `Controls (F3 to hide)`\n\n### UI layout rules (readability)\n- **Prioritize “now” info**:\n  - Always-visible: gold / counts / wave + small mode banner when applicable.\n  - On-demand: the full control list (help overlay).\n- **Avoid spam**:\n  - Toast messages should be short and non-repeating.\n  - Prefer persistent labels for state (intent/banner) over repeated popups.\n- **Truncation/overflow**:\n  - Never overflow panels; truncate long reasoning lines.\n  - Keep bounty labels compact; avoid multi-line text in world space.\n- **Color semantics**\n  - Attractiveness tiers: Low=gray, Med=gold, High=green.\n  - Keep text readable over fog-of-war; use high contrast.\n\n### Acceptance criteria (for UX slice)\n- Selecting a hero shows **Intent** and **Last decision** (or safe placeholder).\n- Last decision shows **age** derived from sim-time (or blank if unavailable).\n- Each bounty shows **Responders** and **Attractiveness tier**.\n- No crashes if hero has no decision yet / no heroes exist / no bounties exist.\n- UI additions do not allocate heavily per frame (keep text generation lightweight).\n\n### Risks\n- **Mismatch between UI “intent” and future intent taxonomy**: mitigate by keeping labels stable and mapping from real fields when they exist.\n- **Perf regression** from per-frame string work: mitigate by keeping computations lightweight and capped; avoid per-frame allocations where possible.\n- **Visual clutter** if too much overlay text: keep bounty markers compact and help toggleable.\n\n### Dependencies / coordination notes\n- **Agent 3 (Architecture)**: eventual stable contract for `hero.intent` and `hero.last_decision` will replace UI-side inference.\n- **Agent 6 (AIBehaviorDirector_LLM)**: align naming for intent labels and ensure “reason” strings stay short.\n- **Agent 9 (Art/VFX)**: optional iconography for attractiveness tiers; must remain readable over fog-of-war.\n\n### Questions back to PM (max 3)\n- Should help overlay default to **ON** for Build A to support onboarding, or **OFF** to reduce clutter?\n- Should attractiveness reflect **global** risk/reward or be **class-aware** (align with AI scoring) in future?\n- Any preferred copy tone: more “Majesty-like” flavor or strictly utilitarian labels for now?\n\n### Recommended next actions\n- Hook future `hero.intent`/`hero.last_decision` contract into UI when available (remove inference).\n- Add hover tooltips for bounty markers (optional) and/or a tiny legend for Low/Med/High.\n- Add a “bounty placement mode” (toggle B, click to place, ESC cancel) if misfires become common.\n",

I reviewed the plan and assessed UI feasibility for scripted 'UI panels open' shots.\\n\\n### Assessment: are UI hooks needed?\\n**Likely NO** (preferred): if `tools/capture_screenshots.py` instantiates a real `GameEngine` and calls its render path, scenarios can deterministically force UI panels open by setting engine fields before rendering:\\n- Right info panel (hero/building): set `engine.selected_hero = <hero>` or `engine.selected_building = <building>` (HUD uses these from `get_game_state()`).\\n- Debug panel: set `engine.debug_panel.visible = True` (and call `debug_panel.render(...)`).\\n- Perf overlay: set `engine.show_perf = True` (and call `render_perf_overlay(...)`).\\nThis requires no sim changes and is deterministic.\\n\\n**If Tools chooses a minimal world-only renderer**, then it may not have easy access to the HUD/debug/perf layers. In that case, we can add a tiny UI-only hook later (see below), but I recommend Tools uses `GameEngine` directly for the `ui_panels` scenario.\\n\\n### UI-only hook proposal (only if blocked)\\n- Add a screenshot-only, stable override in `get_game_state()` (or a lightweight setter on HUD) like `game_state['screenshot_ui'] = {'show_hud': bool, 'force_right_panel': 'hero'|'building'|None, 'show_debug': bool, 'show_perf': bool}` so tools can request panels without sim changes or mouse events.\\nNot implementing this unless Agent 12 reports blocker.\\n\\n### Notes for gallery tool robustness\\n- `.cursor/plans/art_examples` includes a non-image download artifact (`*.crdownload`). Gallery builder should ignore non-image extensions (recommend allowlist: .png/.jpg/.jpeg/.webp/.gif) to avoid load errors.\\n\\n### Cross-agent dependencies\\n- Agent 12 owns `capture_screenshots.py` + `screenshot_scenarios.py` + `build_gallery.py`.\\n- Agent 09 defines the must-capture shot list / framing guidance (zoom, targets).\\n- Agent 11 updates checklist + runs non-crash verification.\\n\\n### Blockers\\nNone currently.

As Agent 08 (UI), I am contributing to **Milestone 0 (style lock)** from a UI framing/palette perspective and preparing the scoped execution plan for **Milestone 4 (UI skin)**. No code changes landed in this round yet (this is an assessment + direction lock step).\\n\\n### Baseline artifacts reviewed (high-signal)\\n- `docs/screenshots/wk3_baseline_v2/ui_panels_seed3/ui_panels_hero.png`\\n- `docs/screenshots/wk3_baseline_v2/ui_panels_seed3/ui_panels_building.png`\\n- `docs/screenshots/wk3_baseline_v2/ui_panels_seed3/ui_panels_debug.png`\\n- `docs/screenshots/wk3_baseline_v2/base_overview_seed3/base_overview__Z1__ui_default.png`\\n\\n### Milestone 0 contribution (UI style lock input)\\nBased on `docs/art/pixel_style_guide.md` constraints (top-left light, 1px outlines, value-first readability, avoid pure black/white) and the reference set, my UI recommendations for the addendum are:\\n- **UI panel framing direction**: move from flat debug rectangles toward a \"carved frame\" look using 1px outer outline + 1px inner highlight (light-facing) and a slightly warmer accent line. Keep corners crisp (no AA).\\n- **Lighting**: treat panels as subtly lit from **top-left** (top edge slightly lighter; bottom edge slightly darker).\\n- **Palette** (initial targets; final values can be tuned by Agent 09 once the world palette is locked):\\n  - Panel fill: keep near current but slightly warmer/darker to avoid looking like IDE overlay.\\n  - Border/outline: near-black (not pure black) + inner highlight.\\n  - Accent: gold reserved for money/important actions; do not overuse on frames.\\n- **Noise budget**: UI should stay **clean/low-noise** so the world art carries texture; use texture only as subtle 2×2 dither in large panel fills if needed (optional).\\n\\n### Milestone 4 plan (UI skin pass — code-only first, assets later)\\nThe current HUD uses `UITheme` + cached `Panel` rectangles; this is a good foundation for a safe skin pass. Proposed incremental approach:\\n1) **Code-only framing upgrade** (no new PNGs): extend `Panel` to support a 2-layer border (outer + inner) and optional top-edge highlight. This should immediately improve `ui_panels_*` shots without asset dependency.\\n2) **Buttons**: unify button styling (Quit / close X / command-bar buttons) into a single helper so they share the same border/highlight language.\\n3) **Icons (later)**: once Agent 09 provides a mini UI icon sheet (CC0 or original), swap text-only command buttons to icon-first with plates/outlines per style guide.\\n\\n### Commands run (required sanity)\\n- `python tools/build_gallery.py --shots docs/screenshots/wk3_baseline_v2 --refs .cursor/plans/art_examples --out docs/art/compare_gallery.html`\\n  - Result: `[gallery] Wrote docs\\art\\compare_gallery.html`\\n\\n### What changed\\n- No files changed in this round (assessment + direction only).\\n\\n### Screenshots improved\\n- None yet (no UI skin changes landed).\\n\\n### Dependencies / blockers\\n- **Dependency**: Agent 09’s Milestone 0 addendum should include a small UI palette swatch (grass/path/shadow/outline/UI bg) so UI and world don’t fight. I can then tune `UITheme.panel_bg/panel_border` accordingly.\\n- **Perf consult**: when we add inner highlights/9-slice later, confirm we keep panel surface caching (no per-frame allocations).\\n- **Tooling**: snapshot system already captures `ui_panels_seed3` deterministically, which is sufficient for Milestone 4 DoD.\\n",
