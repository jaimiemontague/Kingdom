For WK4 planning, I’m assuming the **current reality** (tools are present) and we’re just extending the manifest to include `skeleton_archer`.\n- `tools/assets_manifest.json` does **not** currently include `skeleton_archer`; adding it will be required for validator + enemy_catalog snapshots to cover the new type.\n",

            "raw": "### Status\nAgent 11 (QA_TestEngineering_Lead) — WK4 Round 2 ACK: **Context refreshed**. I have reviewed my own log (wk4_r1 plan-only + wk4_r3 greenlight verification plan) and the required docs. I understand the locked Build A decisions and am ready to proceed with verification-only scope.\n\n**Context restoration:**\n- Reviewed `.cursor/plans/agent_logs/agent_11_QA_TestEngineering_Lead.json` → `sprints[\"wk4-new-enemy-skeleton-archer\"].rounds[\"wk4_r1\"]` and `[\"wk4_r3\"]`.\n- Read required docs: studio-agent-cards (Agent 11 role: prevent regressions, define smoke tests, create minimal automated checks), ai_studio_infrastructure_progress (logging discipline, reply template), WK4 plan doc, visual snapshot system doc (noted doc drift: plan shows pending but tools exist in repo).\n- Confirmed: WK3 is closed/shipped; we are in WK4 planning + kickoff phase.\n\n### Deliverables (Agent 11 role-specific for WK4)\n- **Confirm DoD commands (non-flaky; Build A only):**\n  - `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` (must remain PASS; no new failing gates added unless PM approves).\n  - `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution` (must remain PASS after manifest + placeholder PNGs are added).\n  - `python tools/capture_screenshots.py --scenario enemy_catalog --seed 3 --out docs/screenshots/wk4_after/enemy_catalog_seed3 --size 1920x1080 --ticks 0` (must produce manifest + PNGs including `skeleton_archer` closeup).\n  - `python tools/build_gallery.py --shots docs/screenshots/wk4_after --refs .cursor/plans/art_examples --out docs/art/compare_gallery.html` (must rebuild without error).\n- **Keep Build A non-flaky:**\n  - Verification focuses on **manifest-driven checks** (enemy type present in manifest, placeholder PNGs exist, snapshot manifest includes skeleton_archer entry) rather than brittle positional/behavioral asserts.\n  - No new headless behavior repro scenario added as a **failing gate** in Build A (per wk4_r1 recommendation; optional for Build B only if thresholds prove stable).\n- **Propose optional behavior repro (Build B only):**\n  - If PM wants kiting behavior gated, propose `tools/observe_sync.py --scenario skeleton_archer_repro --qa` with counters (e.g., `ranged_attacks`, `kite_retreats`, `min_target_distance_px`) rather than exact positional asserts. Only gate if thresholds are stable and non-flaky.\n\n### Questions (blockers only; max 3)\n- None. All locked Build A decisions are clear and acceptable for QA verification scope.\n\n### Next actions\n- **After implementation lands:** Run the four required commands above and post PASS/FAIL evidence to `wk4_r3` (or a follow-up round if PM requests).\n- **If PM requests Build B behavior gate:** Propose the smallest deterministic repro harness using scenario counters (no brittle positional asserts).\n\n### Confirmed understanding of locked Build A decisions\n- **Ranged-only in Build A** (no melee fallback) → QA will verify archer does not melee-attack.\n- **Instant-hit ranged in Build A** (no projectile system) → QA will verify damage applies immediately at range; no projectile entity/visual required.\n- **Kiting behavior:** maintain distance band with hysteresis/commitment to avoid jitter → QA will verify via snapshots + manual smoke; no flaky headless gate in Build A.\n- **Deterministic spawn mix:** 80/20 skeleton / skeleton_archer from Skeleton Crypt (using lair RNG) → QA will verify spawn mix via deterministic seeded runs (manual spot-check; not a hard gate unless PM contracts exact ratio).\n- **Pipeline completeness:**\n  - `tools/assets_manifest.json` must include `skeleton_archer` in `enemies.types` → QA will verify via strict validator.\n  - Placeholder PNGs must exist at `assets/sprites/enemies/skeleton_archer/{idle,walk,attack,hurt,dead}/frame_000.png` → QA will verify via strict validator.\n- **Gates must stay PASS:**\n  - `python tools/qa_smoke.py --quick` → QA will run and report PASS/FAIL.\n  - `python tools/validate_assets.py --strict --check-attribution` → QA will run and report PASS/FAIL.\n  - Visual Snapshot System: `enemy_catalog` includes `skeleton_archer` and gallery builds → QA will verify manifest + PNG presence + gallery rebuild.\n- **Allowed clarity safeguard:** tiny deterministic cue (attack pose + minimal impact flash) allowed if needed for readability, but no new systems → QA will verify no new systems introduced (code review signoff from Agent 03).\n\n### Expected file touchpoints (paths only; no code)\n**Agent 11 will NOT touch these files (verification-only):**\n- `tools/assets_manifest.json` (Agent 12 will add `skeleton_archer` to `enemies.types`).\n- `tools/generate_cc0_placeholders.py` (Agent 12 will extend placeholder generation).\n- `game/entities/enemy.py` (Agent implementing will add `SkeletonArcher` class + kite logic).\n- `game/entities/lair.py` (Agent implementing will update Skeleton Crypt spawn table).\n- `game/graphics/enemy_sprites.py` (Agent implementing will ensure sprite loading recognizes `skeleton_archer`).\n- `config.py` (Agent implementing will add `SKELETON_ARCHER_*` tunables).\n- `tools/observe_sync.py` (optional Build B; Agent 12 or implementing agent may add scenario).\n- `tools/qa_smoke.py` (optional Build B; Agent 11 may add profile only if PM approves and thresholds are stable).\n\n**Agent 11 will only touch:**\n- `.cursor/plans/agent_logs/agent_11_QA_TestEngineering_Lead.json` (log entries only).\n\n### Risks + mitigations (QA view on locked decisions)\n- **Determinism risk (kiting/target selection):** Locked decision to use hysteresis/commitment is good, but implementation must use stable ordering (no dict/set iteration) and sim-time only (no wall-clock).\n  - **Mitigation:** Agent 03 will review implementation for determinism compliance; QA will verify via `qa_smoke --quick` (includes determinism guard).\n- **Pipeline risk (strict validator breakage):** Adding `skeleton_archer` to manifest will immediately require placeholder frames in strict mode.\n  - **Mitigation:** Agent 12 will ensure manifest + placeholder generation are atomic (both land together); QA will verify strict validator passes before integration signoff.\n- **UX readability risk (instant-hit feels unfair):** Locked decision allows clarity safeguard (attack pose + minimal impact flash) but no new systems.\n  - **Mitigation:** Allowed safeguard is acceptable; QA will verify no new systems via code review signoff (Agent 03) and manual smoke test.\n- **Spawn mix risk (80/20 may spike difficulty):** Locked ratio is deterministic and testable, but initial balance may need tuning.\n  - **Mitigation:** Agent 05 will provide initial tunables; QA will verify spawn mix via deterministic seeded runs (manual spot-check; not a hard gate unless PM contracts exact ratio).\n\n### Stop condition (ready-for-integration)\n- Agent 11 will mark ready once:\n  1. Implementation lands (manifest + placeholders + enemy class + spawn logic + sprite loading).\n  2. All four required commands PASS and evidence is posted to `wk4_r3` (or follow-up round).\n  3. `enemy_catalog` snapshot manifest includes `skeleton_archer` closeup entry and PNG exists.\n  4. Gallery rebuilds without error.\n",
