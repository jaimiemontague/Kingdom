# Changelog

## Prototype v1.0.0

- Heroes have unique stable IDs (prevents synchronized/clumped behavior from name collisions).
- Enemies retarget attackers when hit while attacking buildings.
- Added Peasants that spawn from the castle, build newly placed buildings, and repair structures (castle repair is top priority).
- Newly placed buildings deploy at 1 HP and are non-targetable until construction begins; unusable until fully built.
- Hero UI panels display potion counts; heroes can buy and carry potions when researched.
- Wave pacing tuned (warmup before first wave + larger, less frequent waves).
