## Steam Early Access Release Checklist (Lightweight)

### Before you announce anything (build readiness)
- **Versioning**: bump version (and date) + update `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Smoke test** (5–10 min): fresh boot, start game, build 1–2 buildings, hire hero, place bounty, survive 1–2 waves
- **Modes**: verify `--no-llm` and default mock/basic AI path work without keys
- **Config sanity**: default settings are fun and not instantly lethal
- **Performance**: quick check with higher hero count (or headless observer) for obvious regressions

### Store assets (minimum viable)
- **Capsules**: main capsule readable at small sizes (logo + one clear scene)
- **Screenshots** (6–10): show indirect control, bounties, heroes fighting, town growth, fog-of-war, UI panel
- **Trailer** (optional early): 30–60s gameplay loop, no narration needed

### Store page copy (publishable)
- **Short description**: single sentence “Majesty-inspired indirect control”
- **Long description**: 1–2 paragraphs + bullets
- **Early Access** section: why EA, what’s planned, current state
- **System requirements**: confirm Windows baseline (and future targets if applicable)
- **Disclaimers**: “Optional LLM providers” + any data/privacy note you want to include

### Update cadence (recommended)
- **Weekly**: small patch or “work-in-progress” post (even if tiny)
- **Monthly**: bigger update with 1–2 headline features + balance pass
- **Quarterly**: roadmap check-in (what shipped vs what moved)

### Patch note structure (consistent every time)
- **Highlights** (3–5 bullets)
- **Gameplay & balance**
- **AI behavior**
- **UI/UX**
- **Performance/Stability**
- **Known issues**

### Launch day comms (minimum)
- Steam announcement post
- Pin a “Known issues + how to run without API keys” post
- If you have a Discord: post patch notes + link to Steam discussion
