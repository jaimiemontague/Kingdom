## Steam Store Copy (Draft)

### Short description (Steam blurb)
Build a fantasy kingdom and hire heroes you don’t directly control—then watch them pursue bounties, shop, and retreat using personality-driven AI (optionally powered by LLMs).

### Long description
**Kingdom Sim** is a Majesty-inspired “fantasy kingdom sim” where you rule indirectly. You build the town, set incentives, and respond to threats—but your heroes choose what to do next.

Place buildings, hire champions, and post bounties to steer behavior. Heroes decide when to fight, when to retreat, what to buy, and which goals are worth the risk. For key decisions, you can optionally enable LLM providers (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok) for richer, personality-driven choices—or run with mock/basic AI.

From peasant construction crews to wave-based goblin invasions, your job is to create a kingdom that can survive—and prosper—without micromanagement.

### Feature bullets (for Steam page)
- **Indirect control**: build, research, and place bounties—heroes decide their own actions.
- **Personality-driven heroes**: different temperaments lead to different risk/reward choices.
- **Optional LLM decisions**: enable OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Grok (or use mock/basic AI).
- **Economy loop**: heroes earn gold, spend in town, and pay taxes back to your treasury.
- **Wave-based defense**: goblin invasions escalate; prepare or be overrun.
- **Peasants build & repair**: new buildings start fragile and must be constructed; repairs keep your kingdom alive.
- **Fog of war + exploration**: visibility matters as your town expands.
- **Pixel-art readability**: crisp scaling, combat hit/kill VFX, and clear silhouettes (with procedural fallbacks during development).

### “Why Early Access?”
Kingdom Sim is best built with player feedback. Early Access lets us tune pacing, add more hero classes/buildings/enemies, and improve clarity/UX while keeping the core loop playable and evolving.

### Planned during Early Access (draft — adjust to match your roadmap)
- More hero classes (rogue, ranger, wizard) with unique gear and behaviors
- More buildings, upgrades, and economy sinks
- More enemy types, lairs, and mid/late-game pressure
- Scenarios/objectives and world variety
- Improved tutorials, tooltips, and UI readability
- Performance scaling work for large kingdoms

### Current state (what’s in now)
- Playable prototype with kingdom building, hiring heroes, bounties, economy/taxes
- Goblin wave combat, fog-of-war, neutral buildings, peasant construction/repair
- Optional LLM-backed “important decisions,” with mock/basic AI alternatives
