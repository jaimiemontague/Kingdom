# UI Sprites (optional)

This folder is reserved for UI icons that may be added later as real pixel art.

For now, the project provides **procedural** (code-generated) icons via:
- `game/graphics/ui_icons.py`

Intended usage (planned by the sprint):
- **Bounty type** icon (explore / attack_lair / defend_building / hunt_enemy_type)
- **Attractiveness tier** icon (low / med / high)

If/when you add PNG icons here, prefer:
- 16x16 or 20x20
- strong outline + high-value fill
- filename sorting if you ever animate them
